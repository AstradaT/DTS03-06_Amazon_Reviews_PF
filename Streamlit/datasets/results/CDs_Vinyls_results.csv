It wasn&#8217;t until I heard &#8220;Kiss This Thing Goodbye&#8221; in the Summer of 1989 that the love affair started. I&#8217;ve subsequently bought maybe twenty CD singles by them over the years - because like Love and Money, The Bible, The Fat Lady Sings, Deacon Blue, The Big Dish and The Silencers - their B-sides were often as good as (if not better than) the album tracks. Now fans are being treated to a &#8220;Re-Presents&#8221; reissue series of their three albums on A&M; Records - &#8220;Waking Hours&#8221; (1989 and 1990), &#8220;Change Everything&#8221; (1992) and &#8220;Twisted&#8221; (1995). Here&#8217;s the beer-stained details...UK Released 20 January 2014 - &#8220;Waking Hours&#8221; on Universal/Mercury 3753354 (Barcode 602537533541) is a 2CD reissue (in a jewel case) of their 2nd album first issued on A&M; Records 9006 in July 1989. On the success of the &#8220;Nothing Ever Changes&#8221; single in January 1990 in the UK - the album was re-released in February 1990 with the sleeve used on this reissue (45:50 minutes). Disc 2 (51:02 minutes) gathers up 16 non-album studio tracks  from 5 single releases - 2 of which are from 10&#8221; and 12&#8221; singles - so are new to CD. The mastering has been done by GEOFF PESCHE at Abbey Road and the 16-page liner notes (which feature interviews with Currie and Harvey along with press clippings) are expertly handled by TERRY STAUNTON.Having had 4 whole years to craft his song-writing skills, lead singer, bassist and principal writer JUSTIN CURRIE has recruited new band members IAIN HARVEY (guitarist) and ANDY ALSTON on Keyboards and after returning from a small US tour that rejuvenated them - they signed to A&M; with an album full of great melodies that were far more radio-friendly than their well-received but commercially flaccid debut. It&#8217;s a sign of &#8220;Waking Hours&#8221; strength that 4 of its 10 tracks became singles - &#8220;Kiss This Thing Goodbye&#8221;, &#8220;Stone Cold Sober&#8221;, &#8220;Move Away Jimmy Blue&#8221; and &#8220;Nothing Ever Changes&#8221; with a further stand alone single in 1990 - &#8220;Spit In The Rain&#8221;.The original album was beautifully produced with an almost live-in-the studio feel to every track - real songs sung with real feeling. The remaster barely changes that (it&#8217;s four  seconds longer than my old CD) and is truthfully only ever so slightly better. However, album sleepers like the rocking &#8220;Opposite View&#8221; and the upbeat &#8220;When I Want You&#8221; now sound gorgeous. &#8220;This Side Of The Morning&#8221; sounds so like Rod Stewart circa &#8220;Every Picture Tells A Story&#8221; - a massive compliment in my book. And the whole album still stands up as a total listening experience.And there&#8217;s more improvement on the bonus disc where the B-sides have been given a right old polish. Disc 2 is extraordinary in many ways - there&#8217;s at least three meisterwerks on here - the unbelievably rock-soulful and lyrically brilliant &#8220;So Many Souls To Change&#8221; which focuses on corporate greed screwing our world up - the wistful &#8220;we gave away our innocence...&#8221; song &#8220;Don&#8217;t I Look Like The Kind Of Guy You Used To Hate&#8221; and the lovely yet distinctly Scottish melancholy of &#8220;Spit In The Rain&#8221; - released as a stand-alone single in October 1990 after the album (lyrics from it title this review). Fans will especially enjoy the acoustic strum of &#8220;Fred Partington&#8217;s Daughter&#8221; which was exclusive to the 10&#8221; vinyl single of &#8220;Kiss This Thing Goodbye&#8221; and the ramshackle but fun version of &#8220;This Side Of The Morning&#8221; which we are assured was recorded live at 2 a.m. in a car-park somewhere (exclusive to the 12&#8221; vinyl single of &#8220;Move Away Jimmy Blue&#8221;). Both of these rare tracks make their first CD appearance here and are very welcome additions.Never hip and somehow derided in some circles as a poor-man&#8217;s Faces - I loved del Amitri with a passion. OK this reissue isn&#8217;t going to set die-hard fans on fire - but they produced a corker in &#8220;Waking Hours&#8221; and this cheap double CD re-boot is a reminder of their brilliance.Both an album and a band that deserve major reappraisal and a ten-spot of your hard-earned. I&#8217;m off now to grow some sideburns...",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cfLN%2BkcZL._SY300_.jpg

And on the 23rd of the month T.Rex and Marc Bolan fans got what they wanted - &#34;The Slider&#34; album hit the record shops and burnt its way into UK consciousness. Even now in 2014 (42 years later) it still gives me a thrill just to look at it (the same applies to &#34;Electric Warrior&#34; from 1971). And this stunning May 2002 2CD DELUXE EDITION from Edsel (reissued in 2014) gives me the same tingles. Here are the Golden Nose Slim and Jungle Face Jakes&#8230;Originally released May 2002 - Edsel MEDCD 715 is a 2CD set (use Barcode 740155171520 to get the right issue) and breaks down as follows:Disc 1 (53:54 minutes):Tracks 1 to 13 are the album &#34;The Slider&#34; &#8211; originally released on vinyl in the UK on 23 July 1972 on EMI BLN 5001Tracks 14, 15 and 16 are Extended Play &#8211; &#34;Cadillac&#34; (14) is a non-album track - it was one of the B-sides to &#34;Telegram Sam&#34; (January 1972 on EMI/T.Rex Wax Co. Label T-REX 101). The other B-side was album track &#34;Baby Strange&#34;.  &#34;Thunderwing&#34; and &#34;Lady&#34; (15 and 16) were both non-album track B-sides to the UK 7&#8221; single of &#34;Metal Guru&#34; (May 1972 on EMI/T.Rex Wax Co. Label MARC 1).Disc 2 (53:00 minutes):Tracks 1 to 13 are &#34;The Alternate Slider (&#34;Rabbit Fighter&#34;)&#34; &#8211; alternate versions of almost every track with similar sounding tracks where alternates could not be found (the initial album title was going to be &#34;Rabbit Fighter&#34;).Tracks 14 and 15 are Extended Play &#8211; &#34;Lady&#34; and &#34;Sunken Rags&#34; - both of which are Outtake Versions of 1972 B-sides (&#34;Sunken Rags&#34; was one of the two B-sides to &#34;Children Of The Revolution').It opens up with two winners &#34;Metal Guru&#34; and the acoustic strum of &#34;Mystic Lady&#34; then barely lets up. &#34;Buick Mackane&#34; is his Led Zeppelin T.Rex and rocks like a monster. &#34;Telegram Sam&#34; was the second number 1 single (&#34;Metal Guru&#34; was the other) and is followed by the song that might have titled the album &#8211; the cool &#34;Rabbit Fighter&#34;. It&#8217;s so quintessentially T.Rex with its acoustic guitars backing lead electric guitars and his &#34;Moondog's a prophet to the end&#8230;&#34; lyrics. I&#8217;ve always loved &#34;Baby Boomerang&#34; &#8211; it was used as a B-side for the infectious &#34;I Love To Boogie&#34; in June 1976 &#8211; and its words oozed that Bolan confidence (lyrics from it title this review). More Rex rockers appear in the guise of &#34;Baby Strange&#34; and &#34;Chariot Choogle&#34; and it ends on the languid &#34;Main Man&#34; &#8211; job done.The end of 1972 would see two more huge singles &#8211; the non-album &#34;Children Of The Revolution&#34; in September and &#34;Solid Gold Easy Action&#34; in December (themselves heavy with unique non-LP B-sides). In fact in the Summer of 1972 and by year&#8217;s end - Marc Bolan seemed to own the world &#8211; he really was flying.The three-way fold-out digipak is pretty &#8211; alternate artwork on the inner flaps &#8211; press adverts and promo stuff beneath the two see-through CD trays - detailed liner notes by T.Rex/Marc Bolan expert MARK PAYTRESS &#8211; lyrics &#8211; track-by-track annotation (with Bolan&#8217;s own recollections) and both CDs carrying the T.Rex Wax Co 7&#8221; single Logo (I remember for all those 45s we ought in Woolworths with the excitement of buying the next Beatles seven).  The remasters are fabulous too &#8211; full of power and muscle &#8211; giving the alternate acoustic versions of &#34;Metal Guru&#34; and the spoken '1, 2, 3 and a 4' leads in to &#34;Rock On&#34; and &#34;The Slider&#34; an eerie feel of being close to genius.Great sound &#8211; quality presentation - and a reasonable price tag for a 2CD DELUXE EDITION &#8211; yum yum. You have to say that Edsel have done the business by his memory and musical legacyWhat a blast...and what a loss. I miss him&#8230;",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NYTBP061L._SX300_.jpg

GEILS BAND guesting - it has somehow slipped into an unfair obscurity. Time to rectify that...Reissued in May 1992 on Rhino R2 70299 (Barcode 081227029920) the CD is a straightforward transfer of the 10-track vinyl album first released August 1972 on both sides of the pond - Atlantic SD 33-364 (USA) and Atlantic K 40240 (UK) respectively.Excepting &#8220;This Old Fool&#8221; and &#8220;Honeydripper&#8221; which were put down in April 1972 in Boston - the other 8 tracks were recorded in October 1970 in the Criteria Studios in Florida (left in the can for two whole years). Co-produced by ERIC CLAPTON, AHMET ERTEGUN, TOM DOWD and MICHAEL CUSCUNA - the sessions also featured J. Geils on Guitar, Magic Dick on Harmonica and Seth Justman on Keyboards - all fellow Atlantic label mates in The J. Geils Band.Eric Clapton plays Rhythm and Bottleneck Guitar with Dr. John On Piano on 7 of the 10 tracks - &#8220;A Man Of Many Words&#8221; (a Buddy Guy original), &#8220;My Baby She Left Me (She Left Me A Mule To Rise)&#8221; (a Sonny Boy Williamson cover), &#8220;Come On In This House/Have Mercy Baby&#8221; (both Junior Wells originals), &#8220;T-Bone Shuffle&#8221; (a T-Bone Walker cover), &#8220;A Poor Man&#8217;s Plea&#8221; (a Junior Wells original), &#8220;Messin&#8217; With The Kid&#8221; (a Mel London cover), &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Know&#8221; (a Willie Mabon cover), and &#8220;Bad Bad Whiskey&#8221; (a Thomas Davis cover).It opens strongly with &#8220;A Man Of Many Words&#8221; (lyrics from it title this review) and continues  just so. Rory Gallagher (an axeman remembered with huge affection) opened his blistering &#8220;Live! In Europe&#8221; LP on Polydor from 1972 with &#8220;Messin&#8217; With The Kid&#8221; and much of &#8220;Plays The Blues&#8221; has that same raucous having-us-a-good-time feel to each track (despite its two year tortured recording history). The great combo of two diverse guitar players and the alternating of lead vocals on each track gives the whole thing a freshness that screams off the tracks even now. Add in complimentary session players and you&#8217;re on a winner.&#8220;Plays The Blues&#8221; is a hugely enjoyable album - I wore out my UK pressing to the point of too-many-scratches - and it&#8217;s a blast to hear it sound so chipper on this lively JOE GASTWIRT remaster.Spend a skydiver on this one - worth every red penny and blue cent...",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61XA3ZEAZ6L._SY300_.jpg

This is just stunning stuff - and as a veteran of nearly 1400 reviews (hundreds for Soul) &#8211; I can safely say that this gorgeous 2CD set may just well be the coolest reissue ever put out in digital history.While 1971&#8217;s &#34;What's Going On&#34; and 1973's &#34;Let's Get It On&#34; are regularly acknowledged as Soul masterpieces and name-checked by everyone who is everyone in love with music that genuinely touches you &#8211; real fans have always had a rush to the head at the mere sight of 1972&#8217;s &#34;Trouble Man&#34; on vinyl. Gaye himself seemed to rate it as his best work and on the evidence presented to us on this fabulous 2013 overhaul &#8211; hot like an oven &#8211; doesn&#8217;t even come close to how good Marvin was at the time. So let&#8217;s get to the Blax facts right away&#8230;Released November 2012 in the USA (January 2013 in the UK) &#8211; Hip-O Select B0017676-02 breaks downs as follows:Disc 1 (73:41 minutes):Tracks 1 to 13 are the album &#34;Trouble Man&#34; &#8211; originally released December 1972 in the USA on Tamla T322L and February 1973 in the UK on Tamla Motown STML 11225. The American issue famously came in a die-cut sleeve with a flap that had him seated beneath the flap &#8211; the UK version came in a single laminated cover with no flap and only the seated photo.Tracks 14 to 22 are all PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED BONUS TRACKS called The &#8220;T&#8221; SessionsDisc 2 (47:37 minutes):Tracks 1 to 19 are &#34;Trouble Man Original Film Score&#34; (in MONO) which features the movie score chronologically reconstructed for the first time since release over 40 years ago. It is PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED in this form.Track 20 is a Film Band Bonus of &#34;T&#34; At The CrossThe three-way fold out digipak looks the business &#8211; the CDs are the same colour as the 1973 American Tamla label while the centre pages of the booklet picture the shot of Marvin sat in his chair from the die-cut sleeve. Under the see-through plastic trays are snaps of tape boxes for Side 1 and 2 and each flap has lovely colour shots of the great man. Very tasty&#8230;But the booklet is a mixture of the beautiful and the baffling &#8211; it&#8217;s 28 pages are gorgeous &#8211; filled with Motown Archive memorabilia, stuff from the collection of Mathieu Bitton, British and American trade adverts from the time, full colour spreads - even Turkish and Japanese pressings of rare singles. There are superb contributions from fans like Joni Mitchell, Lenny Kravitz, movie legend Cameron Crowe and filmmaker George Tillman Jr. (Soul Food, Men Of Honor and Notorious) &#8211;as well as reminiscences from the album&#8217;s song arranger Dale Oehler (Joni used him for &#34;The Hissing Of Summer Lawns&#34;) and the lone guest musician Trevor Lawrence who played Saxophone (Marvin played everything else). All this and detailed annotation on the sessions on the last set of pages etc.  All good&#8230;But then when you get to Page 17 of the Andrew Flory liner notes and the last sentence starts &#34;Less than a year after its release, Trouble&#8230;&#34; &#8211; you turn over the page &#8211; and nothing!

It&#8217;s staggering sloppy for such a classy looking reissue.But although that&#8217;s a goof worth pointing out &#8211; in truth it&#8217;s a sideshow to the real deal for long-time Gaye fans and lovers of this nugget album &#8211; the BEAUTIFUL NEW REMASTERED SOUND and STUNNING PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED EXTRAS&#8230;ANDREW SKAROW did tape Research, JOHN MORALES mixed the bonus tracks and long-standing Universal Engineer KEVIN REEVES did the overall remaster. The work is exceptionally good &#8211; full of muscle and power. The booklet informs us that the 'reconstruction of the score for Disc 2 was painstaking' and it sounds it &#8211; segments I&#8217;ve never heard finally mixed in with what punters saw on the night. Some of it seems to fade out prematurely but I suspect that is to do what they had to work with. Other than that &#8211; track after track &#8211; and you&#8217;re hit with sonic clarity and warmth that is thrilling.I&#8217;ve had the 1998 CD remaster for years and this version is better &#8211; more detail and without being over-trebled for the sake of it. The punch off some of the tracks is shocking &#8211; and who can resist the only single taken off the album &#34;Trouble Man b/w Don&#8217;t Mess With Mister &#34;T&#34;&#34; &#8211; it sounds glorious.The Bonus Tracks on Disc 1 for me are the best &#8211; the Unedited Vocal Version of &#34;T&#34; Stands For Trouble&#8221; is brill &#8211; huge sound and sexy rhythms &#8211; with Marvin scatting over the cool rhythm and Sax. WOW!Over 300 tiny sound cue segments were recorded for the movie and for this reissue the usable cues have been painstakingly cobbled together to make a cohesive whole. It&#8217;s easy to see why music-hall crud like &#34;Pool Hall&#34; was left off the album but slink like &#34;Cadillac Interlude/Cleo's Apartment&#34;, &#34;Crap Game&#8230;&#34;, &#34;Outside Police Station&#34;, &#34;Cleaners/Cleo&#34; and the sexy patter of &#34;Penthouse&#34; are so good and moodily atmospheric that they make you want to check out the actual movie itself (well almost). Although the Film Band Bonus &#8220;T&#8221; At The Cross is probably the worst audio on here &#8211; it&#8217;s string arrangement is lovely and I can hear why it was included despite the wall of hiss that comes at you as it plays.Apart from the presentation glitch &#8211; this is yet another superb Hip-O Select Motown release (they did the award-winning Singles Box Sets Volumes 1 to 12A).As the years go by &#8211; his legend grows &#8211; and I&#8217;ll be honest &#8211; this fabulous reissue made me shed a tear. Put the blame on Mister T people&#8230;",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51J9no3KYxL._SY300_.jpg

What we have here is an entirely different beast...&#34;Here Come The Nice&#34; is a full-on vaults trawl - a 4CD Deluxe Presentation Box Set comprising of 41 Previously Unreleased tracks. In fact the full 75-song compliment has been newly remastered from original Mono and Stereo masters and newly mixed from studio multi-track session tapes for this release. The entire project was overseen by surviving band members IAN McLAGAN and KENNEY JONES - coordinated by Small Faces reissue series producer ROB CAIGER. Scrupulous tape sourcing and recovery of them has taken him over five years alone - with the remastering being handled by sound engineers NICK ROBBINS and ROB KEYLOCH (who were involved in all four of the much-praised 2012 Deluxe Editions - which I've also reviewed).&#34;Here Come The Nice&#34; by SMALL FACES is on Charly/Immediate CHARLY 110 BX and although initially rumoured on the Net to be a US-only release due to licensing issues - it is now a 28 January 2014 Worldwide release (February 2014 in the USA). Housed in a 10&#34; x 10&#34; hard card box - it's a limited edition of 3000 with the certificate inside signed by Kenney Jones and Ian McLagan. Here's a detailed breakdown of the contents:CD1 is &#34;Small Faces Singles - Worldwide As Bs & EPs&#34;20 Tracks - 54:16 minutes. All were issued as 7&#34; single versions/edits around the world and are in MONO. The liner notes also advise which were used on the Mono variants of the albums. None are unreleased but timing errors on old CD reissues have been corrected.CD2 is &#34;Small Faces In The Studio - Olympic, IBC & Trident Sessions - Part 1&#34;18 tracks - 52:17 minutes. All tracks are previously unreleased versions - 1 to 3 and 10 to 12 are MONO - all others are STEREO.CD 3 is &#34;Small Faces In The Studio - Olympic, IBC & Trident Sessions - Part 2&#34;16 tracks - 49:47 minutes. All tracks are previously unreleased versions - 4 to 10 are MONO - all others are STEREO.CD 4 is &#34;Alternate Small Faces - Out-Takes & In Concert&#34;21 Tracks - 63:31 minutes. Tracks 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 are Previously Unreleased. Tracks 17, 18, 19, 20 and 21 are Live from the Newcastle City Hall on 18 November 1968 and are from the Pye Studio master tapes with pitch and speed corrections. Tracks 4, 6 and 12 to 15 are MONO - all others are STEREO.The 72-page colour hardback book has a Foreword by Pete Townshend of The Who and liner notes by noted writer Mark Paytress with contributions from Kenney Jones, Ian McLagan, Rob Caiger, Tosh Flood, Barry Green, Gered Mankowitz, Ken Sharp and Jeff Slate. There are many other Rock celebrity names with quotes as well. As a coffee-table book it's properly gorgeous and the last set of pages in particular (51 through to 69) are beautifully done - featuring song-by-song annotation of the highest quality with new info and great colour photographs.Speaking of photography - I have to admit to massive disappointment at the rather dull-looking 'Lyrics' book. Apart from some full-page Repros of rare single and album artwork - the rest of it is all sepia-tinted black and white photos with not a jot of that great Sixties colour in evidence anywhere (rather like the terrible booklet in The Rolling Stones &#34;London Years&#34; box set). I suspected licensing costs at first (too cost prohibitive) - but its worse. According to Gered Mankowitz (who photographs are long since associated with the band) - Immediate got loads of full colour negatives but Gered never got them back. He was left with only a handful of colour negs literally and boxes of black and white. Hence all that beautiful colour artwork, all that great Sixties look, all that cool promo stuff appears to have been lost or chucked. I say this because after the beautiful colour images in the hardback - the dark pages of &#34;Lyrics&#34; with all the images faded into the back of the text (making some of it almost unreadable) comes as a real visual let down. But - and I should stress this - they've done a classy job with what they've had to work with.There's also a paper repro of the &#34;Ogden's Nut Gone Flake&#34; Press Kit - a three-way fold-out 1967 rarity which pictures the album, the band and lists their personal details as well as some witty Immediate blurb and words.There are 2 facsimile foldout posters in colour - a Live Gig Poster for Newcastle City Hall, June 8th with Gary Walker & The Rain, P.P. Arnold, The Nice & The Sect with John Peel as compere and a foldout advert poster for &#34;Tin Soldier&#34; single on Immediate IM062 (essentially the Picture Sleeve of the British issue).There's 2 Gered Mankowitz Fine Art Prints - the boys holding the Itchycoo Park sign (in colour) and four children holding the same sign upside down (in black and white)There are 5 x Immediate Postcards - photos on front and adverts for singles and albums on the other sideThe signed certificate is presented on a repro of A Tape BoxThe 4 x 7&#34; singles are:1. &#34;Mystery&#34; - Repro of a 1-Sided Emidisc Acetate (on Black Vinyl) delivered to Andrew Loog Oldham in 1967. It was intended to be a single but withdrawn. A handful of the acetates were made.2. &#34;Album Sampler&#34; - Repro of Immediate AS 1 album-sampler for &#34;Small Faces&#34; LP in a Immediate Label Bag on Red Vinyl (this was not on the DELUXE EDITION of &#34;Small Faces&#34;). It has excerpts from 5 tracks with British DJ Tommy Valance introducing in between tracks. The original is very rare.3. Itchycoo Park EP - repro of a rare 1967 French 4-track Immediate Records Extended Play 45 on Blue Vinyl - tracks are Itchycoo Park/I'm Only Dreaming/Green Circles/Eddie's Dreaming4. Here Come The Nice EP - repro of a rare 1967 French EP on Immediate Records Extended Play 45 on White Vinyl. Tracks are Here Come The Nice/Became Like You/Talk To You/Get Yourself TogetherFinally there's a full-sized INFO PAGE on the rear of the box but of course like so many of these US issues it falls off the moment you remove the shrink-wrap which is a pain.SOUND:CD 1 is all MONO and features UK and worldwide single releases - and right from the &#34;Here Come The Nice&#34; opener - you can hear the quality. Very clean and full of presence. &#34;Talk To You&#34; is just stunning as are the rarely heard single edits of &#34;Mad John&#34; and &#34;The Journey&#34; (coupled as a single in Australia and the USA). The sheer mono whack of &#34;Rollin' Over&#34; still sends chills up my spine (&#34;where at man!&#34; indeed!).CD 2, 3 and 4 is where the fun begins. Most tracks on CD2 are stop-start studio run-throughs with cool Londoner wide-boy dialogue in between takes - &#34;I've broken a string man!&#34;, &#34;This will be Take 24&#34;, &#34;Go up an octave Ronnie&#34;, &#34;bit faster Ken&#34; or &#34;we can do better than that!&#34; - and so on. &#34;Wit Art Yer&#34; turns out to be Take 1 of &#34;I Can't Make It&#34; (full of rocking effects guitar and swirling keyboards) which in turn leads into a superb Alternate Stereo take of the song proper. The slang-named &#34;Doolally&#34; has Marriott shouting &#34;Hey&#34; throughout its multiple stops and starts and there's some amazing heavy lead guitar on Take 9 of &#34;Call It Something Nice&#34;.A string of great alternates open Disc 3 while Take 1 of &#34;That Feeling Of Spring&#34; mainlines you right back to the Summer of 1967 with all its echo and giggling. The brass instrumental &#34;All Our Yesterdays&#34; sounds like a Magical Mystery Tour outtake while the Alternate of &#34;Talk To You&#34; in rocking Stereo is so Sixties I can smell the Joss sticks. &#34;Mind The Doors Please&#34; is essentially a 5-minutes drum solo superfluous to anyone's requirements - but far better is a trio of tracks that feel like you're eavesdropping on an acoustic unplugged Small Faces session - &#34;Things Are Going To Get Better&#34;, &#34;Mad John&#34; and &#34;Fred&#34;. I liked these a lot - intimate and stripped down.Another belter and compilation fave of mine is the rocking instrumental &#34;Collibosher&#34; - which was on both &#34;The Autumn Stone&#34; double album and opened Side 2 of the &#34;In Memoriam&#34; LP. Here we get Take 4 and fabarooney it is too. Another shocker is the genuine tenderness in Take 2 of &#34;Jenny's Song&#34; where Marriott sounds like he's Terry Reid doing the gorgeous &#34;May Fly&#34; ballad from 1969. Disc 4 opens with a trio of complete initial stereo takes which are only slightly different brill nonetheless and even more impressive is the rarely heard Mono Northern Soul smack of &#34;(If You Think You're) Groovy&#34; track by The Lot which is P.P. Arnold with The Small Faces. But for me the highlight of the entire set is proper remaster quality given to &#34;Me You And Us Too&#34; which is &#34;Wham Bam Thank You Mam&#34; under another name with different lyrics. It absolutely rocks and encapsulates what I loved about the band's sound at that time (I think it's been on previous CD reissues of dubious origins but never sounding this good). The live stuff is drenched in panting screaming girls and raucous to say the least - but more than anything you get the sheer sonic assault of the band and what a ludicrously exciting live act they were. Impressive trouser snakes boys...WEAKNESSES/NIGGLES:It's far too expensive for what's on offer and following on from the opening paragraph it has to be said out loud that this is `fan' stuff - the casual listener may find it all a bit wearing. I thought CD2 was the weakest of the unreleased stuff (bit cheeky called a 36-second segment a track) but CD3 and 4 more than make up for it.SUM UP:Worth the wait - I think so yes. This is the Small Faces - and for a band so notoriously mishandled down through the decades there's a real sense of people making sure this reissue comes up to muster. And as I drool over the hardback book and listen to that cool Take 1 of &#34;Itchycoo Park&#34; in Stereo once more - I wonder will we ever see their like again. It may cost - but at least this box set remembers them with style and class.It really was all too beautiful folks.PS:The four albums from the period are available as follows - &#34;Small Faces&#34; (Immediate Label) and &#34;Ogden's Nut Gone Flake&#34; are already issued as 2CD DELUXE EDITIONS (see my 2012 reviews) and there is very little duplication with the content of this box. Third is the American LP &#34;There Are But Four Small Faces&#34; which can be sequenced from the 2 DELUXE EDITIONS and the 4th is the sought-after double album &#34;Autumn Stone&#34; which will see a DELUXE EDITION of its own in September 2014.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PCTfpo2gL._SY300_.jpg

And even though the self-titled debut contained heavy hitters like George Harrison, Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann (of &#34;Revolver&#34; fame), Delaney & Bonnie Bramlett, Chris Wood of Traffic, Rick Vito (Bonnie Raitt's band, Bob Seger's band and the Fleetwood Mac band), Derek & The Dominoes and even The Edwin Hawkins Singers  - both were largely ignored by the buying public. Now at last top US reissue label Light In The Attic (using their Future Days Recordings imprint) has given them a newfound respect with a world-class CD reissue.Released June 2013 on Light In The Attic/Future Days Recordings FDR 602 (Barcode 82626853060226) - it breaks down as follows (70:29 minutes):Tracks 1 to 10 is his debut album &#34;Bobby Whitlock&#34; issued March 1972 in the USA on ABC-Dunhill DSX 50121 and on CBS Records S 65109 in the UK.Tracks 11 to 21 is his 2nd album &#34;Raw Velvet&#34; issued November 1972 in the USA on ABC-Dunhill DSX-50131 and in the UK in early 1973 on CBS Records S65301.Produced by Andy Johns and Bobby Whitlock - the debut was recorded in London's Olympic Studios and featured an impressive array of British based Rock musicians. George Harrison and Eric Clapton (guitars) join Bobby Keys on Saxophone (practically an honorary member of The Rolling Stones), Klaus Voormann on Bass with Jim Price on Trumpet and Trombone and Jim Gordon on Drums. That amazing line-up grace three - &#34;Where There's A Will&#34;, &#34;A Day Without Jesus&#34; and &#34;Back In My Life Again&#34; while Clapton also plays beautiful solo guitar on the lovely ballad &#34;The Scenery Has Slowly Changed&#34;.  In fact the softer songs are far better than the rather frantic rushed tunes that are just trying too hard and getting nowhere. Chris Wood of Traffic adds flute to the lovely acoustic &#34;A Game Called Life&#34; - for me a nugget on this rather patchy album (lyrics from it title this review).The second album ups the amps on Side 1 in an attempt to capture the 'rawk' market. It opens with the rockin' &#34;Tell The Truth&#34; - a co-write with Eric Clapton. The countrified cover of Hoyt Axton's &#34;Ease Your Pain&#34; and the almost gospel-rock of &#34;Bustin' My Ass&#34; feature The Edwin Hawkins Singers to great effect. &#34;Hello L.A. Bye Bye Birmingham&#34; features a co-write with Mac Davis and mean slide guitar from Clapton. Things mellow out with Side 2 where he often only employs acoustic guitars, a piano and the Los Angeles Symphony on strings. &#34;You Came Along&#34; is undeniably lovely and Rick Vito's lead playing on &#34;Satisfied&#34; is superb. It ends sounding like &#34;Sun King&#34; from The Beatles 1969 &#34;Abbey Road&#34; album with &#34;Start All Over&#34; - all swirling and prettily ethereal.The remaster is properly great - incredible clarity and presence - even when the raucous ensemble threatens to engulf everything. And the exceptional 48-page booklet entitled &#34;The Bobby Whitlock Story&#34; is done with complete co-operation from the singer himself - photos from his private archives, publicity material, repros of the album labels, detailed track-by-track annotation including his own reminiscences on each song. A lot of work and passion went into this and it shows...To sum up - neither album is undiscovered genius by any stretch of the imagination - but there's plenty of here worthy of reappraisal. And like Rodriguez, Jim Sullivan and Michael Chapman - once again Light In The Attic has given a voice to an artist who deserved better and should be re-heard.Check this one out...",4.0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61TM0kNkV1L._SX300__PJautoripBadge,BottomRight,4,-40_OU11__.jpg"

It's not all bad of course but I'd swear that the \Mothership\"" 2007 remasters sound way better and far more alive - and the 2012 Japanese SHM-CD again features better sound. Anyway here are the details...UK released 2 June 2014 (3 June in the USA) - Atlantic/Swan Song 8122796457 breaks down as follows...Disc 1 (44:56 minutes):Tracks 1 to 9 are their debut album \""Led Zeppelin\"" - originally issued 12 January 1969 in the USA on Atlantic SD-8216 and 31 March 1969 in the UK on Atlantic 588 171 on vinyl LPDisc 2 (71:16 minutes):Tracks 1 to 8 are a PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED concert recorded live at The Olympia Theatre in Paris France on 10 October 1969 (Broadcast 2 November 1969 by the French Radio Station 'Europe 1')The 3-way gatefold card sleeve features alternative artwork on the rear with the original back cover of the LP moved to the inside left flap. The two other inner flaps feature classy black and whites but I must say the alternate artwork leaves me cold. The 16-page booklet has gorgeous black and white/colour photos of the band live at the time - but that's where the good news stops. There are two pages at the rear that give you the basic track info but bugger all else - there are literally no liner notes - nor any history of the album and its importance - nothing from Page or Plant. It's good - but it could have been great - and frankly why isn't it? And as one other reviewer has pointed out - relistening to the album in its entirety - only hammers home what an astonishing debut it was (and still is). But in my heart that's nothing to the sound...I'm certain the sound quality on this album is going to be a bone of contention for many. Don't get me wrong - it does sound very clean - it has power (if you crank it up) - but there's absolutely something missing. To my ears there's no life to these remasters - no air around the instruments - a sort of dead dampened feel to them. I don't know if noise suppression was used and the only reference to 'remastering' is craftily put on the sticker and not any part of the booklet (so no sources are listed). But to my ears the \""Mothership\"" versions are infinitely better. I've done an A/B of the 4 ML remasters with what's on here - and the 2007 versions are full of real presence and power. \""Baby I'm Gonna Leave You\"" for instance is very clean - but again - it feels oddly restrained. Tracks like the Acoustic and Tabla \""Black Mountain Side\"" sound fabulous - as does the barnstorming finisher \""How Many More Times\"" - but \""Good Times Bad Times\"" and \""Communication Breakdown\"" don't thrill like they should.The live disc fluctuates wildly on the sound front - a best approximation is a passable bootleg recording. On the double-opener \""Good Times Bad Times/Communication Breakdown\"" you can so hear the power and magic of a band tearing into its audience with a point to prove - but tracks like \""Moby Dick\"" and \""Heartbreaker\"" sound like rubbish (even if Jimmy Page's guitarwork is off the charts brilliant). Speaking of his axe - the guitar disappears into the mix way too often as does John Paul Jones' Bass and John Bonham's drums. Bluntly if any major label put this out as an official release they would be loudly panned by everyone - especially fans. Also where is the 1969 studio outtake \""Baby Come On Home\"" or the brill \""Travelling Riverside Blues\"" from the 1990-4CD \""Led Zeppelin\"" Box Set - which would have made ideal bonus tracks on Disc 1?I suppose it's a matter of taste when it comes to sound - and I'm open to correction. And there will be those who can quite easily accept what's on Disc 1 - but I for one have to admit to feeling major disappointment after all this wait. Thank God I didn't fork out ninety quid for the Super Deluxe. Answers on a missing mastertape please...PS: see also reviews for the 2CD DELUXE EDITION versions of \""II\"" and \""III\"" (which are far better soundwise and contain genuinely excellent bonuses)""",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SUWsbmnHL._SX300_.jpg

It sounds great and the 'Companion Audio' CD actually warrants the word 'bonus'.UK released 2 June 2014 (3 June in the USA) - Atlantic/Swan Song 8122796453 breaks down as follows...Disc 1 (41:40 minutes):Tracks 1 to 9 is the vinyl album &#34;Led Zeppelin II&#34; - originally released 22 October 1969 in the USA on Atlantic SD-8236 and Atlantic 588 198 in the UKDisc 2 (32:44 minutes):Tracks 1 to 8 are PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED 'Rough Mixes' of Seven album tracks with one New Song - the Instrumental &#34;La La&#34;The 3-way gatefold card sleeve features alternative colour artwork on the rear with the original LP gatefold inner spread on the inside flaps - sided by two new photos of the band during recording.

There's no liner notes - no history of the album and its importance (once rated as Britain's favourite Rock album) - and nothing from Page or Plant. It's good - but it could have been great - and frankly why isn't it?I moaned about the sound quality on some tracks on the debut - that problem doesn't appear here. From the opening wallop of &#34;Whole Lotta Love&#34; - it feels huge and detailed. The cymbals and bass of &#34;What Is And What Should Never Be&#34; are wonderfully clear and &#34;The Lemon Song&#34; sounds suitably grungy (as it was intended). The fade in of &#34;Thank You&#34; is lovely - but it's the sheer power riffage of &#34;Heartbreaker&#34; and its various mad guitar breaks that puts hairs on your chest. Both &#34;Maid&#34; and &#34;Ramble On&#34; have accentuated power (especially in the breaks that feature Bonzo's drums) - and of course it finishes with the lethal one-two sucker punch of &#34;Moby Dick&#34; (crystal clear John Bonham solo) and the Harmonica Blues Boogie of Willie Dixon/Sonny Boy Williamson's &#34;Bring It On Home&#34;. Job done.Disc 2 is a genuine blast - backing tracks with different guitar parts and the occasional vocal jab from Plant. It's a fascinating insight into how they worked and built a tune. It's clear these versions were good - just not good enough. The solos in &#34;Heartbreaker&#34; bear this out - most of the finished solo flourishes that we know and love are in there but some aren't quite 'there' - so presumably Page simply kept working them later until he got those licks to his satisfaction. And it's bizarre to hear the first guitar part of &#34;Moby Dick&#34; - then hear it suddenly stop (no solo) and Bonham then count in the drums as the second guitar part finishes the song. The &#34;La La&#34; outtake with its Motown organ bop and wild acoustic/electric guitar breaks is interesting - but feels most throwaway of the lot.I also bought 1970's &#34;III&#34; this morning and frankly it's the best of the bunch - with fantastic outtakes and two cool new tracks - one of which has me drooling (see separate review).Were Led Zeppelin really as good as we remember them? Were they even the best band in the world?With airship-sized knobs on...and then some...PS: see also reviews for the 2CD DELUXE EDITION versions of &#34;I&#34; and &#34;III&#34;,5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51--hDqYVLL._SX300_.jpg

I&#8217;ve covered his debut &#8220;Home Free&#8221; and its follow up &#8220;Souvenirs&#8221; in another review - here are the details for Volume 2...Disc 1 (38:04 minutes):Tracks 1 to 9 are his 3rd album &#8220;Captured Angel&#8221; first issued in the USA in September 1975 on Full Moon PE 33499 and November 1975 in the UK on Epic S EPC 69189.Disc 2 (45:31 minutes):Tracks 1 to 11 are his 4th LP released May 1977 in the USA on Full Moon Records PE 34185 and June 1977 in the UK on Epic EPC 81574.The 20-page booklet is excellent &#8211; all artwork reproduced, lyrics to both albums, full credits and liner notes by noted writer JOHN TOBLER. With the outer card wrap &#8211; it&#8217;s a classy presentation. But the big news for fans is the fabulous remasters. ANDREW THOMPSON at Sound Mastering in London has done the deed (he&#8217;s handled large numbers of BGO&#8217;s reissues) and his transfers on this 2CD set are beautifully handled. But to the music&#8230;Following the stunning Joe Walsh produced &#8220;Souvenirs&#8221; in 1974 was always going to be hard (it charted at 17 in the States) and in some ways I still remember &#8220;Captured Angel&#8221; as being a disappointment when I bought it as a teenager (it reached Number 23). It&#8217;s opens however with a strong double &#8211; the strings of &#8220;Aspen&#8221; segueing into the Country Rock of &#8220;These Days&#8221; which is followed by the very pretty &#8220;Comes And Goes&#8221; (a firm fan fave). The title track and its Side 1 finisher &#8220;Old Tennessee&#8221; sound nice but lack any real killer melody for me.Things pick up with the piano and Al Perkins Pedal Steel of &#8220;Next Time&#8221; which could have been an Eagles song. Both &#8220;Man In The Mirror&#8221; and &#8220;Below The Surface&#8221; go down the countrified route again - while &#8220;Crow&#8221; really benefits from the remaster with slide guitars beautifully alive in the mix all of a sudden. &#8220;The Last Nail&#8221; goes all Eagles again and the remaster brings his stunning multi-instrumental prowess out of the mud &#8211; very good indeed.Things got very melodramatic with 1977&#8217;s &#8220;Nether Lands&#8221; &#8211; and not in a good way. The opening title track is swamped with huge strings and orchestral stuff that just feels heavy handed. Things improve with the Country Rock of &#8220;Once Upon A Time&#8221; now sounding so good and the pretty accordion piece &#8220;Dancing Shoes&#8221;. Again the shadow of the Eagles surfaces with &#8220;Lessons Learned&#8221; which sounds like &#8220;The Best Of My Love&#8221; (fabulous remaster too). &#8220;Love Gone By&#8221; is trying too hard with its pseudo Rock and Roll franticness - but &#8220;Promises Made&#8221; which sounds &#8216;so&#8217; Dan Fogelberg redeems things. It ends with the echoed piano of &#8220;Sketches&#8221; and the excellent big finisher &#8220;False Faces&#8221; (a true nugget in his song catalogue &#8211; lyrics from it title this review).He would hit paydirt with 1979&#8217;s &#8220;Phoenix&#8221; and really open out with &#8220;The Innocent Age&#8221; double in 1981 (featuring a rare duet vocal appearance by Joni Mitchell on the track &#34;Nexus&#34;).I posted a note on Fogelberg&#8217;s website when he sadly succumbed to cancer in December 2007 - yet another teenage hero of mine gone to the great gig in the sky.Well - now Dan is free - and this beautiful-sounding 2CD reissue does his musical legacy proud.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Ug57%2BtZQL._SY300_.jpg

Their compilations seem to be remastered when they don't say so - or just better mastered than those in the UK, USA and even (dare we say it) - Japan. So I took a 10/$15 chance on their STEELY DAN &#8220;Collected&#8221; 3CD set (see separate review) - and lo and behold - it sounds better. Now I&#8217;m onto another fave rave of mine &#8211; GERRY RAFFERTY &#8211; and I&#8217;m digging big time what I&#8217;m hearing. Each disc is a mishmash of time frames and bands &#8211; so here are the detailed worries and whines for Universal 533 279-4 (Barcode 600753327944)...Disc 1 (76:44 minutes):STEALERS WHEEL - Tracks 1 and 2 are from their debut album &#34;Stealers Wheel&#8221; (1972)STEALERS WHEEL &#8211; Tracks 3 and 4 are from their 2nd LP &#8220;Ferguslie Park&#8221; (1973)STEALERS WHEEL &#8211; Tracks 5 to 7 are from their 3rd and final album &#8220;Right Or Wrong&#8221; (1975)GERRY RAFFERTY - Tracks 8 to 13 are from his 2nd Solo LP &#8220;City To City&#8221; (1978)GERRY RAFFERTY &#8211; Tracks 14 and 15 are from his 3rd LP &#8220;Night Owl&#8221; (1978)GERRY RAFFERTY &#8211; Tracks 16 and 17 are from his 4th LP &#8220;Snakes And Ladders&#8221; (1980)Disc 2 (79:01 minutes):GERRY RAFFERTY All Tracks except 3 - MARK KNOPFLER featuring GERRY RAFFERTYTracks 1 and 2 are from his 5th album &#8220;Sleepwalking&#34; (1982)Track 3 is by MARK KNOPFLER from his Soundtrack Album &#8220;Local Hero&#8221; (1983)Tracks 4 to 9 are from his 6th album &#8220;North And South&#8221; (1988)Tracks 10 to 12 are from 7th album &#8220;On A Wing And A Prayer&#8221; (1993)Tracks 13 to 16 are from his 8th album &#8220;Over My Head&#8221; (1995)Disc 3 (70:00 minutes):THE HUMBLEBUMS &#8211; Tracks 1 to 4 are from their album &#8220;The New Humblebums&#8221; (1969)THE HUMBLEBUMS &#8211; Tracks 5 to 6 are from their album &#8220;Open Up The Door&#8221; (1970)GERRY RAFFERTY &#8211; Tracks 7 to 13 are from his debut Solo album &#8220;Can I Have My Money Back Please&#8221; (1971)STEALERS WHEEL &#8211; Tracks 14 to 17 are from their debut album &#34;Stealers Wheel&#8221; (1972)STEALERS WHEEL &#8211; Tracks 18 to 20 are from their 2nd LP &#8220;Ferguslie Park&#8221; (1973)STEALERS WHEEL &#8211; Track 21 is from their 3rd and final album &#8220;Right Or Wrong&#8221; (1975)The 3-way foldout card digipak houses an inlay in the left wallet with the 3 CDs spread across the other flaps. It doesn't say who wrote the liner notes in the rather tasteful 12-page mini booklet and the only reference to sound is &#34;Mastering: QS Sound Lab&#34;. However listening to my old EMI versions &#8211; the sonic upgrade is noticeably better on the &#8220;Night Owl&#8221; tracks &#8211; especially the fabulous slink of &#8220;Get It Right Next Time&#8221;. The &#8220;Baker Street&#8221; version is the full-album cut at six-minutes plus (so the edited single mix remains a tad elusive) - and the Stealers Wheel tracks have great muscle in them too (lovely clarity on the classic &#8220;Stuck In The Middle With You&#8221;).Fans will also notice that the set is 'not' chronologically lined-up and I'd argue that it&#8217;s so much the better for it. All 3 discs cleverly offer up what feels like mini compilations &#8211; with Disc 3 being the oddest as it features the stuff he did with Billy Connolly when they were comedy folk duo The Humblebums. And while the 1971 Transatlantic Records debut album &#8220;Can I Have My Money Back Please&#8221; is interesting &#8211; I would have much preferred remastered tracks from the &#8220;City To City&#8221; 1979 follow up &#8220;Night Owl&#8221;. There&#8217;s the underrated brilliance of 1982&#8217;s &#8220;Sleepwalking&#8221; (just how good is &#8220;As Wise As A Serpent&#8221;) and lesser-heard later stuff like the lovely &#8220;Over My Head&#8221; title track and &#8220;Down And Out&#8221;.What a songwriter and what a loss. Give this Euro 3CD set a go &#8211; it contains that rare double whammy - quality and quantity&#8230;PS: Artists in this Universal Euro Series are:The Allman Brother, The Band, J.J. Cale, The Carpenters, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Cuby + Blizzards, Fairport Convention, Golden Earring, John Hiatt, Joe Jackson, The Moody Blues, Gerry Rafferty Stealers Wheel and The Humblebums, Shocking Blue, Steely Dan, Cat Stevens, 10cc., Thin Lizzy and Gino Vannelli.I've bought the 10cc set which just sounds like the 1997 remasters and is filled out with a lot of crap solo stuff  - but I hear the J.J. Cale triple has great sound too...",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41WYsxsa5PL.jpg

It features both Ken Saydek (Rounder Records) and Dr. John on piano with Billy Branch on Harmonica and Winter ripping up and down the frets. Holy crap! And Wow!Bluesman &#8211; boogie merchant &#8211; call him what you want. Muddy Waters once called him the best Blues Guitarist in the world.

The 12-page booklet is pleasantly festooned with foreign picture sleeves and affectionate/knowledgeable liner notes by Campbell Devine - author of &#34;All The Young Dudes: The Official Autobiography Of Mott The Hoople&#34;.But the best news for fans is a fantastic new remaster by tape wizard VIC ANESINI whose credits include Simon & Garfunkel, Stevie Ray Vaughan, The Jayhawks, Elvis Presley, Carole King, Hall & Oates and Santana to name but a few. The muscle on the rockers like &#34;Marionette&#34; and the Overend Watts track &#34;Born Late '58&#34; (the only Mott song to feature a non Ian Hunter vocal) is properly great. The singles too &#34;The Golden Age Of Rock 'n' Roll&#34; and &#34;Roll Away The Stone&#34; still thrill in that T.Rex glam kind of way.But for me the bees-knees is the gorgeous ballad to his wife &#34;Trudi's Song&#34; (lyrics above) - the kind of Seventies tune that reduces me to mush for some reason. Even the previously unreleased and aborted single B-side &#34;Lounge Lizard&#34; is guitar-driven find - fab.Great stuff - and in 2014 - this remastered Mott The Hoople CD is cheaper than sunglasses at a Saturday Gig.

Originally UK released June 2006 - Beat Goes On BGOCD709 breaks down as follow:Disc 1 (46:58 minutes):Tracks 1 to 9 are his debut album &#34;Home Free&#34; issued in the USA in October 1972 on Columbia KC 31751 and 1974 in the UK on Epic S EPC 31847 (re-issued in July 1976 on Epic 80697 in the UK).[Note: earlier CD issues of this album have tended to use a `remixed' version of the album that was done in the Eighties. This CD uses the original master tape - so is the album as heard on release].Disc 2 (43:29 minutes):Tracks 1 to 11 are his 2nd LP released December 1974 in the USA on Full Moon Records PC 35872 and March 1975 in the UK on Epic EPC 80623.His debut is good rather than being great but already had his melody strengths on show - a sort of singer-songwriter lone Eagles persona. Tracks like the piano opener &#34;To The Morning&#34; and the largely acoustic &#34;Be On Your Way&#34; are melancholic but also beautiful in their way. It's been years since I first heard these songs (now sounding crystal clear) and a full forty years plus - it's impressive stuff (like a male Judee Sill). But things took a quantum leap with LP number two...With guest appearances on illustrious albums like &#34;So What&#34; by Joe Walsh, &#34;Late For The Sky&#34; by Jackson Browne and &#34;Peace On You&#34; by Roger McGuinn of The Byrds - Fogelberg was already moving in elevated circles when he went to make the gorgeous &#34;Souvenirs&#34; album. Packed with catchy tunes and even a chart hit or two - this hugely polished effort put the album into the Top 50 charts in late 1974. &#34;Part Of The Plan&#34; was even lifted as a 7&#34; single and did reasonably well.Produced by JOE WALSH - &#34;Souvenirs&#34; featuring most of the Eagles (Henley, Meisner, Frey), Graham Nash, Kenny Passarelli, Russ Kunkel, Joe Lala and Al Perkins - the musician credits reads like a whose who of what was hot at the time. In the USA it was issued as a gatefold sleeve but in the UK as a single sleeve with a lyric insert. This CD reproduces the inner American artwork (a painting of his) and the lyrics for both LPs. The John Tobler liner notes are excellent (features an interview with Joe Walsh).But the big news for me is the sound. I had &#34;Souvenirs&#34; on a 2007 Japanese remaster and 5&#34; card repro sleeve - and that was good - this remaster is light years better. It was done by ANDREW THOMPSON at Sound Mastering in London (he handles large numbers of BGO's reissues) and his transfer has brought out Walsh's accomplished original production values. You can hear the squeaking of strings, air around the instruments - even the normally muddied &#34;Part Of The Plan&#34; sounds more open. And musically there's so many goodies on here - &#34;The Long Way&#34; is plaintive and lyrically touching while the gorgeous title track &#34;Souvenirs&#34; (lyrics from it title this review) is the kind of song that seemed to come effortlessly to him. &#34;Song From Half Mountain&#34; where he plays all the instruments himself is also so pretty and the chugging Eagles Rock of &#34;Someone's Been Telling You Stories&#34; is very cool in a Seventies kind of way. &#34;Changing Horses&#34; and &#34;Better Change&#34; still stand up as great melodies too - only the countrified &#34;Morning Sky&#34; lets the side down fro me. All in all - moving stuff.I posted a note on Fogelberg's website when he sadly succumbed to cancer in December 2007 - yet another teenage hero of mine gone to the great gig in the sky.&#34;There's a song in the heart of a woman...that only the truest of loves can release. Set it free...&#34;These lyrics from the album finisher &#34;There's A Place In The World For A Gambler&#34; get me to this day - nearly 40 years after the event.My younger sister Cathy took one look at the album cover and described him as 'beautiful'.Well - now Dan is free - and this beautiful-sounded 2CD does his memory proud.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51adAmShcSL._SY300_.jpg

I&#8217;ve already reviewed his 1974 debut &#34;Sneakin' Sally Through The Alley&#34; and its sexy 1976 follow up &#34;Pressure Drop&#34;. This 2CD reissue on Demon's Edsel label celebrates the next stage &#8211; his 3rd and 4th solo albums.UK released 26 August 2013 (September USA) - Edsel EDSK 7038 (Barcode 740155703837) breaks down as follows:Disc 1 (38:41 minutes)Tracks 1 to 10 are his 3rd Solo LP &#8220;Some People Can Do What They Like&#8221; &#8211; UK released October 1976 on Island ILPS 9420Disc 2 (35:01 minutes):Tracks 1 to 9 are his 4th Solo LP &#8220;Double Fun&#8221; &#8211; UK released March 1978 on Island ILPS 9476The outer card wrap is generic to all these Edsel reissues and certainly gives the whole thing a classy feel. Fans will also know that outside of the &#8220;Gold&#8221; anthology on Universal &#8211; Palmer&#8217;s Island catalogue has been languishing without remasters for decades. Although it doesn&#8217;t say who remastered these album at Universal &#8211; the sound quality is great &#8211; a huge improvement over the dull Eighties discs we&#8217;d had for years. One reviewer is ranting on about MP3 files but I don't hear anything of the sort - and if these are sourced from Universal's remasters for &#34;Gold&#34; then they are vast improvements on what we had before. The 28-page booklet is substantial &#8211; pictures of the albums and rare singles, studio shots, colour publicity stuff, lyrics to both albums, affectionate and knowledgeable liner notes by CHRIS JONES &#8211; it&#8217;s a bang-up job done.Having relocated to the Bahamas and with his 2nd album &#8220;Pressure Drop&#8221; only just released to the shops in April of 1976 &#8211; Palmer was already under pressure to produce another album immediately. Hence only two songs on &#8220;Some People&#8230;&#8221; are originals &#8211; the other 8 are hastily worked out covers. But cobbled out of nothing &#8211; the album is brilliant - and perhaps one of the great lost Funk-Rock nuggets of the mid Seventies.It opens with a Bill Payne original (of Little Feat) &#8220;One Last Look&#8221; and not surprisingly Palmer makes a return to the mighty Feat on Lowell George&#8217;s fab &#8220;Spanish Moon&#8221;. Two absolute belters however come in the shape of drummers &#8211; his pal Alan Powell (the backbeat behind Vinegar Joe) co-writes the brilliantly funky &#8220;Gotta Get A Grip On You (Part II)&#8221; while legendary Kansas sticks man James Gadson (Bill Withers, Marvin Gaye, The Jungle Brothers and later with Beck and Paul McCartney) gives us the stunning &#8220;What Can You Bring Me&#8221;. An old Harry Belafonte Calypso hit &#8220;Man Smart, Woman Smarter&#8221; was funked up and lifted as a single on Island WIP 6345 but it made few inroads. The album ends on a high note though with his own fabulously groovy &#8220;Some People Can Do What They Like&#8221; featuring Old Grey Whistle Test Theme type harmonica wailing from Greg Carroll. The album scraped the Top 100 in the USA. Commercially things fared better next time around&#8230;I recall first hearing the stunning groove of &#8220;Every Kinda People&#8221; &#8211; a song penned by Andy Fraser of Free (lyrics above). I bought the single immediately and played it to distraction (there is a &#8216;Remix&#8217; of it on the 1999 Universal CD compilation that is not included here &#8211; would have made a good bonus track). With a two year layoff Palmer contributed 7 originals to the superbly crafted 10-track &#8220;Double Fun&#8221; album &#8211; the other two covers being &#8220;You Really Got Me&#8221; by The Kinks and &#8220;Night People&#8221; - a new contribution from his old New Orleans pal and genius songwriter Allen Toussaint.The boppin&#8217; &#8220;Best Of Both Worlds&#8221; sees Reggae seeping into his funky style &#8211; the same with &#8220;Love Can Run Faster&#8221; only featuring more piano. Again Richie Hayward, Bill Payne and Paul Barrere of Little Feat are all over the tracks on Drums, Keyboards and Guitars respectively. Things take a string-plucked change with the lovely &#8220;You Overwhelm Me&#8221; &#8211; a great Palmer melody.  And it ends well with the &#8220;Bad Case Of Loving You (Doctor Doctor)&#8221; funk-rock of &#8220;You&#8217;re Going To Get What&#8217;s Coming&#8221; which is just great.I&#8217;ve always thought Robert Palmer was a class act &#8211; not just as singer &#8211; but also as a vessel for other people&#8217;s songs. On this reissue you get a whole lot of both. Bluntly there&#8217;s a hunk of quality Seventies Funk-Rock-Soul-Reggae on offer here for not a lot of your hard earned.Get this fabulous double-CD in your life and you&#8217;ll find yourself sneakin&#8217; those other titles into your shopping basket too.I miss him&#8230;",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YHDjjN5CL._SY300_.jpg

Each card sleeve is now bordered in white but it looks and feels classy (even if the print is tiny). The chunky 40-page booklet doesn&#8217;t scrimp on detail either - track-by-track annotation with photos of the albums, rare music press adverts, liner notes by Michael Eric Dyson and even a letter from the great man himself at the beginning about his long musical journey.But the big news for fans is the stunning new remastered sound carried out by a trio of engineers - MARK WILDER for 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 with 1, 2 and 7 handled by JOSEPH M. PALMACCIO and 3 done by TOM RUFF. Original analogue master tapes have been used in all transfers and what a job they&#8217;ve done...Right from the opening acoustic strum of &#8220;Harlem&#8221; on his fabulous debut album &#8220;Just As I Am&#8221; and onto the gutsy pump of &#8220;Lonely Town, Lonely Street&#8221; which opens the equally brill follow up LP &#8220;Still Bill&#8221; - the sound quality is truly glorious throughout. Beautiful feel - space around the instruments - clarity - warm bass - not to over-trebled - it&#8217;s a top notch job done and makes you re-hear all those wonderful songs anew.And then you&#8217;re hit by that other thing - the sheer wall-to-wall class of his songwriting - properly soulful tunes that etch their way into your heart and won&#8217;t leave. And then there&#8217;s thrill number three - the stuff you haven&#8217;t heard - the discoveries... &#8220;Better Off Dead&#8221; (a B-side to &#8220;Lean On Me&#8221; in the UK in August 1972) and &#8220;Do It Good&#8221; both off the debut - &#8220;Kissing My Love&#8221; and &#8220;Take It All In And Check It All Out&#8221; off &#8220;Still Bill&#8221; - the cool groove of &#8220;Ruby Lee&#8221; (covered by Joe Cocker on his &#8220;Sheffield Steel&#8221; album from 1982) and the beautiful &#8220;Hello Like Before&#8221; both off the massively underrated &#8220;+ Justments&#8221; LP - all of it screams out to be reappraised and loved again.The live double &#8220;Carnegie Hall&#8221; like &#8220;Donny Hathaway Live&#8221; from 1972 has garnished a legendary reputation amongst soul aficionados. Intimate with his audience despite the venue size - a band cooking - songs that sway and groove - it&#8217;s a whole heap of magic.It&#8217;s also pleasing to hear that even into the late Seventies and Eighties - he never lost his knack for a tune - the pretty &#8220;My Imagination&#8221; from &#8220;Naked & Warm&#8221;,  the &#8220;trying to make us happy&#8221; vibe to the finger-tapping &#8220;Look To Each For Love&#8221; from &#8220;&#8216;Bout Love&#8221; and the funky dancer &#8220;Steppin&#8217; Right Along&#8221; from &#8220;Watching You Watching Me&#8221;.The only bum note (if you could call it that) is that Page 13 shows us the rare picture sleeve of the Christmas 1972 US 7&#8221; single for &#8220;The Gift Of Giving b/w Let Us Love&#8221; on Sussex SUX 247. To my knowledge its rare A-side has never been on CD anywhere in the world and unfortunately because this is an &#8216;albums&#8217; set - it isn&#8217;t included here either (when there was room). And although the look is generic to this series by Columbia - I also think the outer box is a tad naff looking. Other than those minor niggles - it&#8217;s a feast. And it&#8217;s cheap too...Somehow like equal giants Bobby Womack, Minnie Riperton and Donny Hathaway - Bill Withers has always been the underdog of Soul - never spoken about in the same awe-struck tones that are routinely given to Aretha Franklin, Marvin Gaye and Otis Redding. In my book he&#8217;s always been right up there with the best of them - a world class Soul Brother - and this ludicrously good mini CD box set is a way in for us mere mortals to that musical greatness...&#8220;I loved that woman...&#8221; he says to the audience as he introduces &#8220;Grandma&#8217;s Hands&#8221; on &#8220;Live At Carnegie Hall&#8221;. Well - we feel the same about you mate.Beautiful and then some...",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510ZglwpKmL._SY300_.jpg

The film is gushingly romantic in a way that might be called 'soppy' these days (starring Christopher Reeves, Jane Seymour and Christopher Plummer) and John Barry's score is simply sublime - beautiful icing on an already very tasty cake.Remastered by Beat Goes On from the original tapes and released July 1994 on BGOCD222 (use Barcode 5017261202222 in the Amazon Search Bar) &#8211; it&#8217;s been reissued at last in September 2013 using the same version as before (31:53 minutes). Disappointingly the gatefold slip of paper that is laughably referred to as &#8216;original artwork&#8217; on the silver sticker that accompanies these reissues is technically right. But it offers up nothing &#8211; and it&#8217;s a shame that Beat Goes On (BGO) didn&#8217;t take this reissue opportunity to spread the wings a bit and fit the insert out with some proper celebratory liner notes (especially given Christopher Reeves sad demise).Still what matters is the music &#8211; and it sounds gorgeous &#8211; lush &#8211; quiet when it needs to be &#8211; full of presence and warmth &#8211; and not ratcheted up for the sake of volume. With most soundtracks the 'theme' or 'refrain' is repeated in varying guises throughout &#8211; and its no different hear. It&#8217;s just that the main theme is so haunting that any amount of variations is welcome. A rather nice deviation is &#8220;Rhapsody On A Theme&#8221; by Paganini with a Piano Solo by Chet Swiatkowski. And it all ends on Track 9 with a final performance of the &#8216;theme&#8217; by Roger Williams.I've been a lifelong Barry fan (and its not just because of the surname) and at one time had over 40 of his original soundtrack albums. But even by his lofty &#8220;Out Of Africa&#8221; and &#8220;Diamonds Are Forever&#8221; masterpiece standards - &#34;Somewhere In Time&#34; is exceptional in its entirety.Get this solid gold star in your reasonably priced car as soon as possible. And it&#8217;s a lifetime regret that I never saw the Maestro live (my brother did and talks about it today).

Here are the singer-songwriter details&#8230;UK released September 2013 (October in the USA) &#8211; the 2CD Edsel EDSK 7034 (Barcode 740155703431) breaks down as follows&#8230;Disc 1 (62:38 minutes):Tracks 1 to 9 are his debut solo album &#34;First&#34; &#8211; released October 1973 in the USA on Elektra EKS-75066 and K 42150 in the UKTracks 10 to 19 are his 2nd album &#34;Never Let Her Go&#34; &#8211; released February 1975 on Elektra 7E-1028 in the USA and May 1975 on Elektra K 52012 in the UKDisc 2 (58:30 minutes):Tracks 1 to 6 are the album &#34;Goodbye Girl&#34; &#8211; released July 1978 on Elektra 6E-148 in the USA and K 52091 in the UKTracks 7 to 16 are the album &#34;Falling In Love Again&#34; &#8211; released June 1980 on Elektra 6E-251 in the USA and K 52206 in the UKThe generic card wraps that Edsel now uses on their reissues are lovely &#8211; classy looking too. The chunky 36-page booklet inside is jam-packed with details &#8211; album sleeves, 7&#8221; singles, Quad album labels, lyrics to the songs and informative liner notes by noted writer Alan Robinson. It&#8217;s beautifully done.Sound &#8211; these albums were remastered by Rhino initially and Phil Kinrade at Alchemy has clearly used those versions because this is sonically brilliant stuff. The audio is amazing &#8211; well produced &#8211; not overdone &#8211; muscle and clarity on every track.Musical proceedings open with a peach &#8211; &#34;Sail Around The World&#34; &#8211; and two things immediately hit you - the stunning sound quality and the prettiness of the melody (lyrics above). It was put out as a 7&#8221; in the UK in November 1973 (K 12126) but only charted in the USA (peaking at 50). Speaking of lost singles - the near nine-minute epic &#34;Suite: Clouds, Rain&#34; was edited down to the piano opening of &#34;Clouds&#34; (very Bread) and put out as a 7&#8221; in the UK in July 1973 with &#8220;Soap (I Use The)&#8221; as its B-side (K 12114). I mention this because it&#8217;s rare edit is a no-show here - which is a missed opportunity. The debut album ends strongly with &#34;Sight & Sound&#34; (very Eagles) - while &#34;Lorilee&#34; gets a bit &#34;Countdown To Ecstasy&#34; Steely Dan slinky with Jim Horn on Alto Sax (tasty).The second album picks up where the first left off (even with the two-year gap). &#34;Never Let You Go&#34; gets straight into &#34;Baby I'm-A Want You&#34; territory and it&#8217;s easy to see why it was chosen as the lead off single (the rocky &#34;Watch Out&#34; graced the flipside). The acoustic ballad &#34;Part Time Love&#34; was the second and last 45 from the LP (June 1975 in the UK on K 12157) &#8211; a lovely tune. &#8220;Strangers&#8221; ends the album well &#8211; but even at this stage &#8211; there&#8217;s a feeling of ordinariness about most of the record.By the time we reach 1978&#8217;s &#8220;Goodbye Girl&#8221; and 1980&#8217;s sluggish &#8220;Falling in Love Again&#8221; &#8211; the muse seems to have abandoned him entirely. There are moments like the lightweight radio funk of &#8220;Took The Last Train&#8221; and the schmaltz of &#8220;Where Does The Loving Go&#8221; which is clearly trying to emulate the glory days of early Seventies Bread. But these albums have been dollar-bin fodder for years &#8211; and with reason.So there you have it &#8211; a very mixed bag. But then there is that fabulous sound - and those melodic nuggets on the first two albums especially that make the purchase worthwhile. He could always pen a tune and melody that would get to you...and that's what I like most about this excellent value-for-money Edsel double...",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wbOMcRVxL._SX300_.jpg

Contractual and legal crap left them penniless and drove their gifted songwriter Pete Ham to despair &#8211; literally taking his own life in April 1975.The band had little control over the title of their first album on their new label (originally to be known as &#34;For Love Or Money&#34; as a pun) and little control over the curious 'girl with a cigarette and riding crop' naff artwork. And with Badfinger&#8217;s last album on Apple having only just hit the UK shops in March of 1974 (&#34;Ass&#34;) &#8211; it probably wasn&#8217;t the smartest of moves to hit punters with two more albums that same year. But history also shows that Badfinger had an ace up their sleeve - their songs. And it&#8217;s very evident from the opening salvo on the first four tunes on &#34;Badfinger&#34; &#8211; that they were back in top form &#8211; sort of England&#8217;s answer to Big Star &#8211; all tunes and melodies and great hooks that stay with you.This fantastic October 2013 2CD set from Edsel of the UK on EDSK 7036 (Barcode 740155703639) gives us both of those 1974 albums and a further disc of 14 BBC In Concert tracks between 1972 and 1973. It breaks down as follows:Disc 1 (76:03 minutes):Tracks 1 to 12 are their 5th album &#34;Badfinger&#34; &#8211; released July 1974 in the UK on Warner Brothers K 56023 and August 1974 in the USA on Warner Brothers BS 2762Tracks 13 to 21 are their 6th album &#34;Wish You Were Here&#34; &#8211; released October 1974 in the UK on Warner Brothers K 56076 and November 1974 in the USA on Warner Brothers BS 2827Disc 2 (68:03 minutes):Tracks 1 to 7 were recorded in concert at the Paris Theatre in London on 8 June 1972Tracks 8 to 14 were recorded at the same venue but on 10 August 1973. Jeff Griffin expertly produced both BBC sessions for the &#8220;In Concert&#8221; programThe outer card wrap gives the whole reissue a quality feel &#8211; as does the chunky 28-page booklet which pictures the albums, publicity photos, track by track recording info, American promo Singles, and exceptionally detailed, affectionate and caustic liner notes by Rock Expert and long-time Edsel Associate ALAN ROBINSON. It&#8217;s both a pleasure and a horror to read (never had a group such bad luck).PHIL KINRADE at Alchemy has obviously used the Rhino remasters and the sound quality is fabulous &#8211; especially bringing out those layered vocals which original Producer Chris Thomas captured so well.It&#8217;s easy to see why the album openers &#34;I Miss You&#34; and &#34;Shine On&#34; were picked as an A&B; for the first single off the record in the USA (Warner Brothers WB 7801) &#8211; great tunes. The second 45 &#34;Love Is Easy&#34; was issued in Germany in a band-photo picture sleeve (Warner Brothers WB 16323) but it did little business. Pete Ham's &#34;Lonely You&#34; and the wonderful &#34;Song For A Lost Friend&#34; have such pretty melodies (lyrics above) and were somehow indicative of the band&#8217;s overall fortunes.&#34;Just A Chance&#34; opens the &#34;Wish You Were Here&#34; album with a rocking hit (shame it wasn&#8217;t lifted as a radio single). Joey Molland&#8217;s &#34;Got To Get Out Of Here&#34; sounds like acoustic Oasis while &#34;No One Knows&#34; and &#34;Dennis&#34; sound like the &#34;Pacific Ocean Blue&#34; album of 1977 by Beach Boy Dennis Wilson &#8211; dense with guitars and adventurous vocals. One of the best on here is &#34;Love Time&#34; and it rocks out with &#34;Meanwhile Back At The Ranch/Should I Smoke&#34; loaded with bittersweet lyrics like &#34;should I laugh or should I cry&#8230;won&#8217;t somebody help me&#8230;&#34;The BBC Stuff is a raucous blast &#8211; with the band much rockier than you would imagine. The first session features two great covers of Dave Mason songs &#8211; a nine-minute romp through his Traffic hit &#34;Feelin' Alright&#34; and his own solo track &#34;Only You Know And I Know&#34; (superbly covered by Joan Osborne on her 2002 &#34;How Sweet It Is&#34; CD album). &#34;Better Days&#34; even sounds like Lynyrd Skynyrd circa 1974's &#34;Second Helping&#34; at times. They even go funky with &#34;Matted Spam&#34; and Bob Seger boogie on the finisher &#8220;I Can&#8217;t Take It&#8221;. After the ever-so-slightly over-produced nature of both studio albums &#8211; these loose live renditions feel like a breath of fresh air.Why do some bands make it and some don&#8217;t &#8211; bad luck, bad judgement, bad handling by people who should have known better.At least we have this excellent reminder of what really matters &#8211; the music...",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61PHkgl03ZL._SX300_.jpg

With the mercurial Bowie a fan and his star exploding everywhere &#8211; the timing and the song was perfect.The 9-track &#34;All The Young Dudes&#34; vinyl album was originally UK released in September 1972 on CBS Records S 65184 &#8211; and this April 2006 Columbia/Legacy CD reissue runs to a generous 72:57 minutes. The album was originally produced by David Bowie (also plays Sax on some tracks) and this CD reappraisal offers up fans 7 properly excellent additions that actually warrant the moniker 'bonus tracks' - a rare single edit of &#34;One Of The Boys&#34;, 4 previously unreleased demos and two incendiary live versions recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1973.It has to be said that the 8-page booklet is disappointingly slight with a centre spread liner notes by Ben Edmonds, recording details and precious little else&#8230;. But the meat and potatoes lies in a fantastic new remaster by tape wizard VIC ANESINI whose credits include Simon & Garfunkel, Stevie Ray Vaughan, The Jayhawks, Elvis Presley, Carole King, Hall & Oates and Santana to name but a few.It opens with a great cover of Lou Reed's &#34;Sweet Jane&#34; (lyrics above) where Mick Ralphs puts in some fantastically fluid Guitar playing. The muscle on the piano and guitar of the &#34;Don&#8217;t Stop!&#34; Intro to &#34;Momma's Little Jewel&#34; is just great as is Verden Allen&#8217;s slightly Prog Rock organ soloing throughout. It&#8217;s the first properly cool Hunter song on the album (co-written with Bass player Overend Watts).I&#8217;d have to admit a possible travesty here &#8211; I&#8217;ve always loathed the title track &#8211; it seemed hammy to me then and still does now &#8211; and it hung around the band's musical neck for decades. But at least it got the job done. Fat better is the menace of &#34;Sucker&#34; and the fabulous snotty British Rock 'n' Roll of &#34;Jerkin' Crocus&#34; (a B-side to the USA 7&#34; single of &#34;Sweet Jane&#34;). It's back to Prog Organ for Verden Allen's &#34;Soft Ground&#34; where he unwisely ruins the song by taking Lead Vocals. Better is the Mick Ralphs double &#34;Ready For Love/After Lights&#34; where you can 'so' hear the beginnings of Bad Company (Hunter and Ralphs share vocals on this one). It ends on a short but poignant Ian Hunter piano balled &#34;Sea Diver&#34; &#8211; for me a real highlight - and like &#34;Trudi's Song&#34; on 1974's &#34;The Hoople&#34; &#8211; a hidden gem in their catalogue.The bonus tracks are shockingly good &#8211; especially &#34;Black Scorpio&#34; which is a pumping Rock Demo Version of &#34;Momma's Little Jewel&#34; and &#34;Ride On The Sun&#34; which is an equally delicate demo of &#34;Sea Diver&#34; but with different lyrics. It's still odd to hear David Bowie actually sing &#34;All The Young Dudes&#34; - but it actually suits him more. In fact what a single this previously unreleased duet between Bowie and Hunter would have made (as a double credit perhaps?). The reissue finishes with the huge guitar punch of &#34;Sweet Jane&#34; - a track that will thrill fans of the Lou Reed live classic &#34;Rock 'n' Roll Animal&#34;.So there you have it &#8211; a great album and a properly fab trip down Rock&#8217;s Memory Lane. It's a real shame that the booklet doesn&#8217;t celebrate &#34;Dudes&#34; a bit more (an Indie label would have splashed out 20-pages or more) but what is on offer is sonically brilliant - a fantastic remaster by Anesini.With principal song-writer and singer Ian Hunter still at the helm &#8211; the band would go on to even better things with the beautifully presented &#34;Mott&#34; album in 1973 and the underrated 6th LP &#34;The Hoople&#34; in 1974 (see reviews).Now in 2014 this remastered Mott The Hoople CD is cheaper than a stick of eyeliner at Boots.

With the mercurial Bowie a fan and his star exploding everywhere &#8211; the timing and the song was perfect. All they needed to do was to consolidate that fresh beginning &#8211; and 1973&#8217;s &#34;Mott&#34; followed through in real style.The 9-track &#34;Mott&#34; vinyl album was originally UK released in July 1973 on CBS Records S 69038 &#8211; and this April 2006 Columbia/Legacy CD reissue runs to 58:42 minutes. The album was originally produced by the band (with Andy McKay of Roxy Music guesting on Sax) and this CD reappraisal offers fans 4 additions &#8211; &#34;Rose&#34; the non-album flip of &#34;Honaloochie Boogie&#34;, 2 previously unreleased demos of &#34;Honaloochie Boogie&#34; and &#34;Nightmare&#34; and one incendiary live version of &#34;Drivin' Sister&#34; recorded at the Hammersmith Odeon in 1973. Oddly the single edit of &#34;All The Way From Memphis&#34; is AWOL when there was plenty of room to include it.It won&#8217;t take British fans very long to notice that the gorgeous gatefold die-cut artwork of the original 1973 UK LP with it&#8217;s centred plastic face and inner lyric bag is completely absent - sloppily replaced with reissue artwork. At least the 12-page booklet is better than the scrappy 8-page affair that afflicts the 2006 Legacy CD of 1972&#8217;s &#34;All The Young Dudes&#34;. This time we get liner notes by Keith Smith (Editor of Two Miles From Heaven), detailed recording info, lyrics and even the D.H. Lawrence piece &#34;A Sane Revolution&#34; that appeared on the rear cover artwork. But the colour-photo montage that&#8217;s on inner gatefold is missing and the booklet&#8217;s impact is negligible when the original LP was a thing of beauty.Offsetting the disappointing presentation however is the real deal - a fantastic new remaster by tape wizard VIC ANESINI whose credits include Simon & Garfunkel, Stevie Ray Vaughan, The Jayhawks, Elvis Presley, Carole King, Hall & Oates and Santana to name but a few.It opens with the full album version of the rollicking &#34;All The Way From Memphis&#34; which to this day makes me smile (lyrics above). The grungy boogie of &#34;Whizz Kid&#34; could so easily have been a rocker on Bowie's &#34;Ziggy Stardust&#34; and the melodrama ballad &#34;Hymn For The Dudes&#34; is properly great Mott The Hoople - the &#34;Thunderthighs&#34; girly backing vocalists adding real power to a great song. The trio that follow &#34;Honaloochie Boogie&#34;, &#34;Violence&#34; and &#34;Drivin' Sister&#34; show the differing song approaches of two huge talents &#8211; Ian Hunter and Mick Ralphs &#8211; both giving Mott The Hoople Rock, fun and that fabulous British Rock 'n' Roll swagger. But again it's the ballads that get you &#8211; the 1972 Live In Zurich &#34;Ballad Of...&#34; and the lovely acoustic strum of &#34;I Wish I Was Your Mother&#34; see the album finish on a real high.The four bonus tracks are a typically mixed bag of the good and the average. Favourite is the beautiful ballad &#34;Rose&#34; &#8211; the non-album flip of &#34;Honaloochie Boogie&#34; (a long-prized Mott item). Musically as good is Verden Allen's &#34;Nightmare&#34; &#8211; that is until he opens his mouth and starts singing &#8211; he&#8217;s a terrible voice. The reissue finishes with the huge guitar punch of a live show opener &#34;Drivin&#8217; Sister&#8221; &#8211; but it&#8217;s already appeared on the 30th Anniversary issue of &#34;Mott The Hoople Live&#34;.So there you have it &#8211; a great album and a properly fab trip down Rock&#8217;s Memory Lane.

The remasters are fabulous too &#8211; full of power and muscle &#8211; giving tracks like the acoustic strum of &#34;Life Is Strange&#34; and the chugging rock boogie/vocal phasing of &#34;Rapids&#34; huge presence.&#34;Tanx&#34; achieved the same top chart position of 4 in the UK that &#34;The Slider&#34; did in the previous summer &#8211; yet I&#8217;d argue it actually has better tracks. To this day the seductive strings and melody of &#34;Electric Slim And The Factory Hen&#34; get me &#8211; sounding so advanced for its time. Thanks to Mark Paytress and his tireless search for all things Marc - I now know that the girl who giggles the intro to the brill &#34;Mad Donna&#34; is the daughter of an executive at CBS France! I still don&#8217;t know if I like the sax intro to &#34;The Street And Babe Shadow&#34; but I like the song and his musical progression. Yet the sax works in tandem with the Mellotron on &#34;Mister Mister&#34;. The &#34;oh baby&#34; groove of &#34;Shock Rock&#34; has great guitar boogie but awful lyrics. But then Bolan goes all soulful and gospel girly vocals on the wonderful album finisher &#34;Left Hand Luke And The Beggar Boys&#34; which Paytress rightly suggests bears more than a passing resemblance to tracks on The Stones 1972 opus &#34;Exile On Main St.&#34;As with &#34;The Slider&#34; 2CD reissue &#8211; the bonus tracks on Disc 1 add hugely. Who amongst his fans doesn&#8217;t hold a torch for the non-album singles Children Of the Revolution, Solid Gold Easy Action and 20th Century Boy (and their equally cool B-sides). As you can imagine the 'alternate and demo' versions on Disc 2 are a mixture of the fabulous and the throw away. The 2:13 minute frantic alternative of &#34;Solid Gold Easy Action&#34; is fantastic &#8211; rocking T.Rex unleashed - while the Acoustic Demo of &#34;Mister Mister&#34; may be hissy but it&#8217;s wonderfully intimate. The demo of &#34;Tenement Lady&#34; sounds like he&#8217;s using a heavy-stringed Dobro and comes complete with false start - and it's strange to hear &#34;Left Hand Luke&#34; dropped from its near 6 minutes on the album to a two-minute acoustic strum - tender and moving (lyrics from it title this review). Nice.Great remastered sound &#8211; quality presentation - and a reasonable price tag for a 2CD DELUXE EDITION. You have to say that Edsel have done the business by his memory and musical legacy. There is an album-only single-disc version on Edsel&#8217;s budget label CODE 90 (Catalogue Number Code 90 NINETY 16 - Barcode 740155301620 - 34:56 minutes) &#8211; but I&#8217;d plum the few extra quid for this (just so worth it).On the spoken intro to &#34;Xmas Riff/Born To Boogie&#34; he says, &#34;This is Marc Bolan here. I&#8217;d like to wish you all a super funk Christmas and a golden New Year&#8230;&#34;Job done my son.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41H81GC4P1L._SX300_.jpg

Cale and his wonderfully laid-back songwriting magic has never been higher. And his superb 1972 debut album &#34;Naturally&#34; will be a first port of call for many. Four tracks from it were remastered for the 2CD Anthology &#34;Any Way The Wind Blows&#34; in 1997 - but this 2013 Japanese SHM-CD represents the first time the entire album's been sonically overhauled. However - given the poor quality of the original 1970 and 1971 recordings - even this best ever audio remaster of &#34;Naturally&#34; has its drawbacks.Released in Japan 26 June 2013 on Universal UICY-75627 (Barcode 4988005771582) - it's a SHM-CD (Super High Materials) and features Repro US LP artwork including the colour-coded Track/Musician breakdown on the rear cover that's missing from the card digipak of &#34;Naturally&#34; in the 2013 &#34;Classic Album Collection&#34; 5CD box set.A SHM-CD doesn't require a special CD player to play it on (compatible on all machines) nor audiophile kit to hear the benefits. It's a new form of the CD format which picks up the nuances of the transfer better (top quality make). I own about 10 of them and they're uniformly superb. Also this 'actually remastered' reissue of his debut album is 13 seconds longer than the previous Eighties non-remaster (32:26 minutes as opposed to 32:13). The booklet is the usual 8-white pages of Japanese liner notes and a stab at the English lyrics - nothing to really get your teeth into. It should also be noted that the old issues of this CD and the one in a card digipak in the 2013 &#34;Classic&#34; box set are NOT REMASTERS.SOUND:I wore out original tan label issues (and silver and green label reissues) of &#34;Naturally&#34; on Seventies vinyl trying to find a copy that didn't sound like a wall of hiss coming out of the speakers. I now know why. Although the improvement in sound here is extensive - the original sessions were dogged with excessive hiss on the master tapes - and I'm afraid that's what you largely get on this 2013 reissue - only accentuated more in some cases.Hiss culprits include &#34;Call The Doctor&#34;, the lovely &#34;Magnolia&#34; and &#34;River Runs Deep&#34;. But the piano on &#34;After Midnight&#34;, the fiddles on &#34;Clyde&#34; and Mac Gayden's slide guitar on &#34;Crazy Mama&#34; are all wonderfully clear - major improvements. &#34;Woman I Love&#34; and &#34;Bringing It Back&#34; (lyrics above) are the kind of tracks that don't turn up on &#34;Best Of's&#34; that often - and I'm thrilled to say that they both sound stupendous - stunning clarity on the bass and brass. &#34;Call Me The Breeze&#34; (covered to stunning effect by Lynyrd Skynyrd on 1974's &#34;Second Helping&#34;) kicks in nicely too after that beat-box rhythm opening. But overall I'd say that those expecting audiophile from this release should probably cry off - but for those who love the man and his music - then this remaster is a must-buy. Even with that hiss - the clarity is the best yet.J.J. Cale was one of my audio heroes growing up - and his influence on Eric Clapton, Dire Straits and even John Mayer is undeniable. What a loss and what an artist.And damn the Japanese for being so good with these bloody things (I've also reviewed &#34;5&#34; and &#34;Troubadour&#34;) - because I need all 8 of them now! My long suffering bank manager will be pleased.The albums in this June 2013 Japanese CD reissue series are:1. Naturally (1972) on Universal UICY-756272. Really (1973) on Universal UICY-756283. Okie (1974) on Universal UICY-756294. Troubadour (1976) on Universal UICY-75630 [SEE REVIEW]5. &#34;5&#34; (1979) on Universal UICY-75631 [SEE REVIEW]6. Shades (1981) on Universal UICY-756327.

And that&#8217;s when the love affair started. I&#8217;ve subsequently bought maybe twenty CD singles by them over the years - because like Love and Money, The Bible, The Fat Lady Sings, Deacon Blue, The Big Dish and The Silencers - their B-sides were often as good as (if not better than) the album tracks. Now fans are being treated to a &#8220;Re-Presents&#8221; reissue series of their three albums on A&M; Records - &#8220;Waking Hours&#8221; (1989 and 1990), &#8220;Change Everything&#8221; (1992) and &#8220;Twisted&#8221; (1995). Here&#8217;s the beer-stained/used-condom details...UK Released 20 January 2014 - &#8220;Change Everything&#8221; on Universal/Mercury 3755684 (Barcode 602537556847) is a 2CD reissue (in a jewel case) of their 3rd album first issued on A&M; Records 395 385 in June 1992 (50:58 minutes). Disc 2 (68:38 minutes) gathers up a whopping 18 non-album studio tracks from multiple variants of 4 single releases. The mastering has been done by GEOFF PESCHE at Abbey Road and the 16-page liner notes (which feature interviews with Justin Currie and Iain Harvey along with press clippings) are expertly handled by TERRY STAUNTON.Like it&#8217;s A&M; predecessor &#8220;Waking Hours&#8221; - the 12-track &#8220;Change Everything&#8221; was chock-full of radio friendly hits. &#8220;Always The Last To Know&#8221; (May 1992), &#8220;Be My Downfall&#8221; (July 1992), &#8220;Just Like A Man&#8221; (September 1992) and &#8220;When We Were Young&#8221; (January 1993) were all released as singles with each sporting 7&#8221;, 10&#8221;, 12&#8221; and CD single formats. Unfortunately for die-hard fans (and unlike the &#8220;Waking Hours&#8221; reissue which has at least two tracks on it that were exclusive to vinyl) - all 16 on Disc 2 are from the CD singles. So if you&#8217;re like me and you&#8217;ve collected the lot - all you&#8217;re getting here is a slight sound upgrade. But as just under seventy minutes - Disc 2 is still stonking great value for money especially given the quality of the tunes. Even the live variants are fantastic with a really witty intro from Paul Whitehouse as mock DJ Mike Smash...Speaking of the remaster on the album itself - it&#8217;s hard to notice it. The original was a full-on live-in-the-studio feel recording and was beautifully produced by Gil Norton in the first place. A slight amping up is the best way to describe this version - nothing radical - but then like U2&#8217;s &#8220;Achtung Baby&#8221; from 1991 - it doesn&#8217;t need a remaster. What is impressive is the sheer song quality and sonic blast that accompanies them. Hooky as Hell and lyrically brilliant - lead singer, bassist and principal songwriter Justin Currie could pen a tune.

I even dig their cover of &#8220;Cindy Incidentally&#8221; - a band and time-period they clearly worshiped.Never hip and somehow derided in some circles as a poor-man&#8217;s Faces - I loved del Amitri with a passion. OK this reissue isn&#8217;t going to set die-hard fans on fire - but they produced yet another corker in &#8220;Change Everything&#8221; and this cheap double CD re-boot is a reminder of that brilliance. Both an album and a band that deserve major reappraisal and a ten-spot of your hard-earned.I&#8217;m off now to pine for girls who do you wrong and live on the wrong side of the London to Glasgow tracks...",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BHJU6KxDL._SY300_.jpg

Cale and his wonderfully laid-back songwriting magic has never been higher - and if you want an example of just how good he was (and can sound) - then a few bob spent on this fabulous Japanese CD reissue is going to be money well spent. And more importantly to long-time fans - this 'actually remastered' reissue has GLORIOUS SOUND trumping all other releases. Here are the gory details...His 3rd studio album &#34;Okie&#34; was originally issued on vinyl album in April 1974 on Shelter SR-2107 in the USA and June 1974 on A&M; Records AMLS 68261 in the UK (excepting one song, they're all Cale originals). Its first CD appearance was way back in 1990 on Mercury 842 102-2 - but it was an OK-sounding CD rather than a great one. A whopping 6 of its 10 tracks were remastered in 1997 for the 2CD anthology &#34;Any Way The Wind Blows&#34; and fans got to hear just how good it could sound. But little will prepare them for the stunning sonic attack of this 2013 remaster - beautifully transferred and fully realizing the magic that was always there.Released in Japan 26 June 2013 on Universal UICY-75629 (Barcode 4988005771605) - it's a SHM-CD (Super High Materials) and features 5&#34; Repro US LP artwork and a booklet with lyrics. The OBI mentions that this disc is part of the &#34;Rock Impact '74&#34; Series.A SHM-CD doesn't require a special CD player to play it on (compatible on all) nor does it need audiophile kit to hear the benefits. It's a new form of the format that picks up the nuances of the transfer better (top quality make). I own about 10 of them and they're uniformly superb. Its total playing time is a mere 29:06 minutes but don't let that deter you - it's probably the sweetest of all his LPs.On the subject of sound - a few words first about the remaster (and Cale's remasters in general). Both Amazon UK and USA list the 5CD mini box set &#34;Classic Album Selection&#34; as having 2013 remasters (&#34;Okie&#34; is not among them) - it doesn't. Although the CDs look exactly like the old issues, closer examination will show that each has a new catalogue number that reflects the box - but that's all. They all have the old Mercury designed labels of silver and orange lines and are precisely the same as the old Eighties and early Nineties reissues. My Mac even remembered the old track references I'd personally put in. I tried an outside source - like a desktop CD player - same thing - same old discs - absolutely not new. So where does this '2013 Remaster' claim come from? I suspect from these Japanese SHM-CD reissues which are Universal Japan issues only. The point is that the sound difference between this SHM-CD and the ordinary 'digitally mastered' disc of the 1990s is literally like chalk and cheese.It doesn't say which engineer has done the remaster and transfer in the booklet but the work is AWESOME - truly beautiful sound on every track. If I were to nail down two that show most improvement  - it would be &#34;Starbound&#34; (lyrics from it title this review) and the country jaunt of &#34;Precious Memories&#34; - neither of which are on the 1997 Anthology. There is hiss on these tunes but the clarity of the songs is GORGEOUS. &#34;The Old Man And Me&#34; is beautiful too and the lone cover on the album &#34;I'll Be There (If You Ever Want Me)&#34; by Rusty Gabbard and Ray Price rocks along with superb clarity. Love it love it.J.J. Cale was one of my audio heroes growing up - and his influence on Eric Clapton, Dire Straits and even John Mayer is undeniable. What a loss and what an artist. And damn the Japanese for being so good with these bloody things - because I need all 8 of them now! My long-suffering bank manager will be pleased...The albums in this June 2013 Japanese CD reissue series are:1. Naturally (1972 - his debut) on Universal UICY-75627 [SEE REVIEW]2.

The Best of Link Wray,"LINK WRAY-RUMBLE! THE BEST OF LINK WRAY: Behind the dark shades and greased pompadour, LINK WRAY was the ultimate guitar hero for the ages. His incredibly raw and startlingly innovative instrumental work made him one of rock's biggest influences on six stringers from PETE TOWNSHEND and JEFF BECK to CUB KODA and JIMI HENDRIX. Slicing effortlessly into rockabilly, RNB and country, often within the same song, the ominous thumper RUMBLE, his signature tune, had distorted power chord effects achieved by poking holes in an amp with a pencil. WRAY's grungy echo-laden chops, stripper tempo selections and wry sense of humor (check out the kitschy spoken sound bites on BATMAN THEME) made ACE OF SPADES, JACK THE RIPPER and RAW-HIDE...his only Top Twenty single outside of RUMBLE...cult classics of the highest order.

In spite of a few missing gems like THAT GIRL COULD SING, the 32 track VERY BEST doubles the content of his only previous anthology THE NEXT VOICE YOU HEAR...a plus for die hard fans who can never get enough of JACKSON BROWNE's poignant, introspective outpourings.RATING: FOUR LAWYERS IN LOVE",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51SnE0sOshL._SY300_.jpg

The '70s Soul Experience,"CAN YOU DIG IT? THE 70S SOUL EXPERIENCE-VARIOUS ARTISTS: Before disco pretty much wiped it off the charts at the end of the decade, seventies soul music was an extension of one the previous decade's most popular, dance inducing genres. Making the scene on this six disc box set are holdovers from that era including SLY & THE FAMILY STONE, THE ISLEY BROTEHRS and THE TEMPTATIONS, along with a new set of players like TOWER OF POWER, KOOL & THE GANG and WAR, whose sweaty funk tendencies brought a whole new groove to the equation. From THE FRIENDS OF DISTINCTION's middle of the road pop heavy smashes and THE STAPLE SINGERS' solid message bearing efforts to JOE TEX's raw, blistering throw downs, there's something to fit every taste here; even the disco era stuff from LTD, TAVARES and AVERAGE WHITE BAND easily transcends that label. In the end, it's all about soul and it's all good, right down to the 136th track (a relative obscurity from ROSE ROYCE)...this is the six pack that you'll want to bring to every party.RATING: FIVE 'FROS",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51riG9gJkiL._SX300_.jpg

I love ls though , so I had to get this and it's worth your money if you enjoy this band  Just don't expect it to be on the level of what came later.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61CcPYbxdcL._SX300_.jpg

This makes fans say they are losing it. However this is a very good release from a great band. Great music would come from them again of course and there are several great songs on here.  &#34;Saturday night special' , is one of them.  All the others are very good though.  So a weaker ls release is still filled with a lot of good songs and a few great ones. The boys at this point were out of control as well that party lifestyle was already taking it's toll.  Ed king was still around for this one too.  So casual fans will won't to go with their greater releases but to be sure this hasn't a bad song on it. So fans like me are more than happy, but like all fans we want stronger discs on the whole as well..  I can say that this is weaker than their first two for sure.

'the elephant man' is the best song on here. There's a alternative version of 'all hells breaking loose' with kiss. And most of the songs have decent enough sound , a few of the demos are not so great soundwise ,but very clear sounding.  demos are often done on simple recordings machines. There are snippits of interviews as well. I would recommend this one to any kiss fan.  And  it's hard to believe that this nice and talented man has been now dead for 23  years.  (cancer) .  But then it's sad to lose anyone at any age. Some of these songs should have been done by kiss for sure.  The shandi demo is not with kiss I believe. But it was his audition tape for the band.  This is not a regular completed cd of course , (it's demos and outtakes)  if you want that you will be disappointed , but if you want a piece of kiss history and a remembrance of a fine man and talent musician. then you will have that here.  rip eric.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A4UMbcF3L._SY300_.jpg

This is the one completests would want in their collection and casual listeners may be less happy with.  The songs are done the way lennon wanted them to sound and it is a hit and miss affair for many people. I can listen to the whole thing and enjoy every song though. SO I like this one.

However they were able to not only cover other artists very well , but to release their own songs , songs that were very much  pop rockers or rockers of the time.  These songs give you feel for the time too. Just like a good 4 seasons record would Rock was about short songs and such and danceable beats. That's what you get here  , to expect more is insane , 1962-63 isn't even similar to 1965 as far as music was concerned! .  That's how fast things changed. But this is good stuff .  It's hard to imagine that only five years later this would be seen as something quaint.

They just kept a single track with all of side A and another one with all of side B, which is OK, since I usually play the whole thing anyway, but... I don't know. There is a considerable pause between the actual songs and they could have made a track number change on those spots. Not sure why all CD versions of the album were made this way.

But the booklet does include all lyrics.  &#34;Children of god&#34; is represented with a cross while &#34;skin&#34; is represented with a snake. Two sides of a coin, I suppose. But Skin is actually the &#34;light&#34; material and less important.This is the only edition currently available of &#34;Children of god&#34;. The recording is at times different from the old album (I still have an old LP edition of it), but it does sound slightly better. I only wish they hadn't messed with the cover. &#34;World of skin&#34; could have been a separate release.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OGovwdlBL._SX300_.jpg

His world is a theatre of conceptual darkness where mood and atmosphere are the key elements of sound.  The 34-minute center track is a reign of haunting terror that moves from gently twisted sound vibrations to all-out wall-shattering noise.  The 8-minute &#8220;Oxygen&#8221; finds a devastating angular lock-funk groove that escalates to slide guitar mayhem over anguished yelps.  Other moments of soul-searching intensity include:  An apocalyptic marching folk music dirge that builds to a white noise ending.  Slow & dramatic psychedelic blues ballad soundscapery with some creepy found-sound conversations and laughter that elevates in tension.  Disturbed hypnotic chants that emphasize repetition as a conquering tool.  A mantra-like, percussive death-clatter that pursues the P.I.L. area of Eastern rock until it self-immolates.  A Savage Republic style buzz-drone of tribal echoes that finishes with a slow-growing, burning blast of earth-shattering noise-scrapes.  Band members on this epic double album have played with the Heroine Sheiks, Shearwater, Ministry/KMFDM.  Guest artists include members of St. Vincent, Cold Specks, Angels Of Light, Colour Revolt, The Paper Chase, Larsen, Beat Circus, Myopic, Wires On Fire, etc.  Swans pay  a lot of attention to detail, which requires the listener to do the same.  &#8220;To Be Kind&#8221; is not kind; It&#8217;s a deep, swallowing hole that is all about the journey downward.

I also find it comical to see all the reviews claiming you must buy the UK version. Trust me, there is no way two songs can make that much of a difference! I would also say that Paint It Black is the best song on the album so if that is omitted that is a major minus. Now I will not say this is terrible but as with any Stones prior to 1968 there is a major step down from their best work. I own 23 Stones albums and would rank the three Stones eras the following:1. pre 1968- three stars at best, some nice songs in there but not consistent masterpieces, the blues covers are fine but we all know that this band was far superior to be doing blues covers. It does provide good historic perspective though. Not enough driving rock guitar for my tastes.2. The golden era 1968-74: This is clearly the pinnacle of the Stones with an amazing run of albums. Mostly five star material here and even It's Only R & R and Goats Head Soup have many solid tracks3. The disco new Stones era includes Some Girls, Tattoo You, Undercover, Steel Wheels: Highly underrated by many and for me much more enjoyable than the old 60's stuff. Mostly four star material with a few five star gems thrown in.Anyway, if you love 60's music you will most likely love Aftermath.

I do not think there has been enough mention on here about how GREAT the third disc is, with versions of the songs that easily could have made it on to the original album. Specifically the Another Brick In The Wall songs are fantastic and in my opinion almost better than the album versions. I also must mention that these are vastly different than the songs, with different lyrics in alot of places. It is amazing to hear these to understand the working process of finalizing the songs on the album. Other songs are clearly still in progress and not the polished masterpieces that they would become. Either way, I think that many people are selling this short as I read in one review it was something you only needed to hear once. BS. Many of these demo versions are fantastic and fresh and I will be listening to them over and over. I may even make a mix and add some of the best demo's to the Wall in different places.To mention the re-master: What about the original sound of this incredible album would even make you think it needs to be re-mastered in any way at all!!?? Of course it doesn't!!! I will probably never even listen to it. I bought this set only for disc three which greatly exceeded by expectations. These &#34;demo's&#34; sound pristine and the word demo really does not even do them justice!Lastly, what a collection of crappy reviews on this site that seem to have been written by ten year olds! We don't care if your CD was crushed in shipping or if it never arrived. Those are simply useless reviews. Also, reviewing the original album is fine but what people really want to know is &#34;how is disc three&#34; and how does the re-master sound (if they care about that).

First the positives, I liked the song selection. The inclusion of Dogs was great although it is not a good as the studio version. Set The Controls For The Heart of The Sun is probably my favorite song here and very well executed. The Wall songs sound fantastic except for Mother. The Final Cut song is nice and pretty well done and Shine On You Crazy Diamond is strong. I did not have a huge problem with the fill in guitar players but will say there is only one David Gilmour. The downsides include the &#34;cringe worthy&#34; back up singing on many of the songs. I cannot reach for the skip button fast enough on songs like Mother. In reading the CD booklet notes I was concerned by the idea of giving every musician his own space to add something of their own to the songs. Roger Waters should have simply sang all of the David Gilmour parts, this would have been acceptable. Instead the songs are so transformed, absolutely NOTHING like the originals because a trio of female singers are in place of the many of the Gilmour parts. Other criticisms include having another version of Money and some underwhelming Dark Side songs. In my opinion both Pulse and the highly under-rated Delicate Sound blow this away. The best live Floyd out there is on the Experience versions of Dark Side and Wish You Were Here. I have also heard that The Wall live show Is There Anybody Out There is also incredible. The David Gilmour live in Gdansk is simply stunning and highly recommended. Sadly, I do not see playing this disc that much with so much other incredible live stuff to chose from.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UyHppYG8L._SY300_.jpg

So I'll remedy that.It was and is surely one of the most exquisite sounds ever to be produced in the human throat and it is allied to an acute musical intelligence and sensibility. This is a cunningly selected anthology of religious and liturgical music, mostly of the sunnier, more melodious variety but not cloying or sentimental. The fifty-strong band that supports her is uncredited but they produce a refined sound and are clearly made up of gifted New York City locals; they play with taste and restraint, not in period style but without Schmaltz or overt Romanticism. The oboe, harp and organ soloists are excellent and never overpower Battle's light sound. Her agility and breath-control are as impressive as ever; the top notes shine and the slight huskiness in the lower reaches of her voice enchants. She sings fluently in English, German, Latin, Italian and French and the booklet provides quadrilingual translations. The music spans the Baroque, through Classical to the High Romantic period, and embraces a wide range of musical idioms from the Lied to the Afro-American Spiritual, the latter &#34;Were You There?&#34; sung a capella with flawless intonation.The only piece unfamiliar to me was the dreamily floating, chromatic &#34;Schlafendes Jesuskind&#34; by, unexpectedly, Hugo Wolf; it reminds me a little of Richard Strauss&#8217;s Christmas song &#8220;Die heiligen drei K&ouml;nige aus Morgenland&#8221; but without the Angst. However, my favourite is the &#34;Echo Aria&#34; from Bach's &#34;Christmas Oratorio&#34;, in which Battle's gently lilting vocal line is echoed by the oboe and a perfectly matched boy treble.This might not be one of the largest voices ever to grace an opera stage but it is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful; fans of her sound need not hesitate.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5156lolLb7L._SY300_.jpg

Find a way to play them side by side if you don't believe me: there is a warmth and transparency to the Pristine issues that is completely missing in the hissy, scratchy EMI transfers; furthermore the stability of pitch is noticeable compared to the wow and wobble on EMI. There is no soupiness in the Pristine set, just a new, full-bodied clarity.The filler is different for both sets: EMI provides no.11, Op.95, while Pristine give us no.7, Op.59, the first &#34;Rasumovsky&#34; quartet.

Re-engineered by Pristine, they become irresistible - as long as you do not object to the random expressive scooping.Of course, there is plenty of competition from other bargain and/or modern sets: I value the Hungarians on Regis, the Medici on Nimbus, the Tokyo on Sony and of course the Smetana Quartet's earlier recordings on Supraphon - but these are the urtext versions and every collector should own them - only buy them on Pristine.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hKEViRwSL._SX300_.jpg

I have been and shall continue to be in trouble for declaring that I find him to be the dependably and perennially Mr Boring of conducting with only a notable handful of exceptions in his discography and this recording conforms to my every prejudice.It is a piece I love and of which I have many recordings, headed by those conducted by Shipway, Karajan and Thielemann, so I have a firm idea of what I want to hear - and it is not as subtle as what Haitink gives us here. First, even the recorded sound is portly and bass-biased. Secondly, the LSO's sound is smoothly homogenised and soporific. Thirdly, I'd lost patience with Haitink by the first orchestral climax at sun-rise, which passes as quietly and blandly as a milk float. That sets the tone for the impeccably well-mannered performance which succeeds; everything is swathed in silk and sunk in soup.Heavens knows, there are enough thrilling, life-enhancing recordings of this adventure story without our needing to settle for such mediocrity.

Robbins Landon praised these fine recordings of the Paris Symphonies by Karajan and the BPO.I weary of feeling under some obligation to begin every review of recordings such as these by defensively explaining that they do not have to come from the Period Practice stable to be first-rate in every sense. They are musically sensitive and provide a truly satisfying listening experience for anyone not ideologically wedded to squawking strings, clipped phrasing and breathless tempi. There is certainly nothing either soupy or lumbering about these performances,  except for an admittedly regrettable tendency to adopt speeds which are too deliberate in the Minuets and thus lack wit.Otherwise, the playing here falls so gratefully on the ear, as it should when you combine the greatest 20C orchestra and conductor with mature Haydn in superb DG digital sound. Karajan's late conversion to Haydn indicates that he found some new significance in his music and he clearly understands the organic structure of these symphonies; under his baton they hang together coherently rather than sounding liek a string of highlights.The grandeur, good humour and inventiveness of Haydn's orchestration emerge enhanced by Karajan's approach; what suffers, perhaps, is the requirement that Haydn's sly surprises and cheeky innovations be more readily pointed; humour was not perhaps HvK's string point although like most very intelligent artists he could be drily sardonic.Haydn himself was delighted to be given a commission for a band so very much bigger than the one he directed at Esterh&aacute;zy. The brilliance and virtuosity of the BPO would no doubt have pleased him as much as the amplitude of the sound they make.

I had always heard of it as being some kind of gold standard recording by virtue of its drive and passion and I am happy to agree with a previous reviewer that the conducting is &#34;white-hot&#34;.Fricsay made another, later recording in 1960 but unfortunately that, too, is mono and opinion is divided about which is the better; on balance, most plump for this one by virtue of its having the same soprano is younger, fresher voice and a far more propulsive approach, resulting in the duration being only 75 minutes, allowing it to fit neatly onto one CD, whereas Fricsay is much more leisurely in the later, live recording.Neither recording boasts the best team of soloists; here, the tenor is very musical but rather small-scale-white-voiced and inclined to aspirate. The bass Kim Borg is rather windy and hollow, not especially Italianate in the required black-browed fashion but he is expressive. The mezzo is the very sturdy, slightly plummy Marianna Radev, whom I have not previously encountered but she is certainly up to the demands of the part without being very imaginative. She, like Oralia Dominguez for Fricsay in 1960, is almost the star of the show by virtue of the amplitude of her voice. Stader, as I said, is in good voice but I like my Verdi sopranos to be somewhat meatier and more dramatic of tone. Nonetheless, she soars as she should in her high-flying passages, despite her rather &#34;little-girly&#34; sound.It is the vigour of the choral contribution and the drive of Fricsay's direction which lend real distinction to this performance. He is somehow less overt and crude than Solti while being equally aggressive.This is a fine vintage recording without being quite the paradigm some reviewers have dubbed it and the mono sound, good as it is, is inevitably rather too constricted to do full justice to such an epic work. Still, the spirit of Fricsay's aesthetic stance emerges intact and he gives us a compact, thrilling ride.A word of caution: some might be irritated by the Teutonic Latin pronunciation in an &#34;Italian-Latin&#34; work; it takes a little getting used to.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61INPgfzcAL._SY300_.jpg

However, contrary to a previous reviewer, I did not find Graham's voice to be especially large or resonant in the challenging space of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden and I wonder if that is why the balance here is slightly too tipped towards her rather than being equally balanced with the orchestra; hence some instrumental detail is slightly recessed or obscured.I have previously admired John Nelson's Berlioz but here he seems slightly restrained to match the classical poise and understatement of his elegant singer; hence there is little especially striking in these performances beyond a generalised loveliness. No song is particularly differentiated from another and to be honest, I found my attention wandering when usually I am riveted by these most engaging of melodies.The rest of the programme is of plums from Berlioz's operas and dramatic cantatas. Graham sings in impeccable French and seems wholly at home in the idiom.

Despite his reputation for leisurely tempi, Giulini's is in fact closer to Levine's excellent Tanglewood live recording, slightly faster than several other notable recordings from the likes of Karajan and Previn, and much pacier than Tennstedt in his magnificent but rather etiolated version. On the other hand, he does not approach the Jeggy jog-trot or the swift propulsiveness of Masur in his New York account, so for many this will be ideal, especially as he commands the Viennese forces needed to lend sonorous dignity to proceedings. As always with the combination of Giulini and the VPO, you get aureate beauty of sound combined with delicacy and detail. Just occasionally the entry of the choir is a little woolly but they rise splendidly to what is always for me the key point in this work, the &#34;Aber des Herrn Wort bleibet in Ewigkeit&#34; outburst, which should make the nerves of your neck-hairs tingle..The soloists are excellent, too, especially Andreas Schmidt, caught here shortly before his splendid baritone started to get rocky and lose lustre all too early in his career. While I greatly admire Barabara Bonney's purity and legato, there is just a touch too much of the &#34;little girl&#34; timbre in her sweetness for me, but I quibble; this is still marvellous singing.The recorded sound is terrific, catching the atmosphere of the live performance with hardly any of the usual attendant distractions of extraneous noises.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P2GM7ZSWL._SY300_.jpg

There is a bloodless quality here that hardly satisfies although as sheer sound it&#8217;s impeccable, as is the technical brilliance of the orchestra. The Prelude to Act III of &#34;Lohengrin&#34; is neat, elegant and rather tame, while the vertical sense of spirituality that Kempe brings to the Act I Prelude is simply absent - maybe its absence derives from the foursquare phrasing or lack of variation in dynamics but it doesn't move the listener as it should; the introduction of the woodwinds at 1'52&#34; is perfunctory. The overture to &#34;Die Meistersinger&#34; is simply plodding and stolid; there is no sense of release at the climax. The &#34;Rienzi&#34; overture needs more enthusiasm and attack, although the medley of great tunes is attractive in itself. The Prelude and &#34;Liebestod&#34; to &#8220;Tristan&#34; is the most successful orchestral item here: poised and intense but hardly rapturous.My disappointment is compounded by my adverse reaction to Measha Brueggergosman's voice. I wasn't impressed when a friend introduced me to her some while back, although she has been gaining rave reviews.

The sound is very fine if occasionally just a little coarse and tubby but it captures the concentration of a life performance and the balance of instruments is excellent. There is virtually no extraneous or audience noise, apart from a little grunting from the Maestro. This was a favourite symphony for Bernstein and he chose it for his farewell concert 25 years after his debut as Music Director of the orchestra here.It is weighty but never ponderous; the Scherzo is especially released and exuberant and the Brooklyn Boys' Chorus is almost unruly in its attack, which creates a robust effect far preferable to the prissiness which affects some renderings. The playing of the New York Philharmonic is especially commendable and if anything superior to the earlier, 1961 recording, just as Christa Ludwig is preferable to Martha Lipton.Bernstein's noble restraint in the opening of the finale pays off as he keeps his powder dry for the cataclysmic climax; this builds and builds through 28 minutes. Only Maazel takes as long in what is for me an almost equally recommendable recording with the VPO and certainly other outstanding performances are less overtly affectionate, starting with Tennstedt's searing, but comparatively brisk live account, Sinopoli in Stuttgart, Mehta and Abbado's earliest recording with the VPO. These are all wonderful recordings as this symphony has been fortunate on records but there is no denying Bernstein's ability to generate a special kind of intensity.

He was, perhaps, in even better voice eleven years earlier but his then  partner, Joan Sutherland was already too mature whereas Studer is here in finest form in her mid-thirties; she is technically and tonally very well equipped for the role with a light, flickering vibrato and a silvery sheen to her soprano, often employing an effective portamento. Not everything she does quite comes off - there are some unsteady pianissimi and moments of flailing for the top notes but by and large hers is a very intelligent, touching and believable account. Pavarotti, too, had by this stage acquired the irksome habit of rounding off too many phrases with an explosive &#34;uh&#34; and his tone is undoubtedly less sappy than of yore, but compared with successors he is a god. He is especially animated in Act II Scene 2, the gambling scene when he shames himself by insulting Violetta. His live &#34;Don Carlo&#34; a year later at La Scala under Muti has similarly been unfairly excoriated yet it seems to me that he was in exceptionally good voice in the early 90's.The rest of the cast is ordinary. Juan Pons is an adequate if occasionally somewhat blustery Germont; he makes a nice job of his arias without being very memorable.Levine's conducting is tender and energised by turns and the playing of the Metropolitan Orchestra excellent. It's a pity that Levine regresses by permitting some irritating cuts in the score.My favourite performance remains the live Covent Garden recoding with Callas, Valletti and Zanasi under Rescigno in 1958 but this one is a contender if you like the artists concerned, even if no-one can approach Callas's pathos and nuanced delivery of the text. For many, too, Caball&eacute;'s delicacy as Violetta represents a benchmark performance, accompanied by Bergonzi and Milnes under an unfortunately unyielding Pretre.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-gLhimuoL._SY300_.jpg

I have the older issue which is impressive enough but the remastering for the Karajan Gold label is by all accounts even better. As long as it is not edgy, digital sound was made for the combination of Karajan, the VPO and Bruckner; this is a demonstration disc and by no means the performance of a sick old man, being somewhat more propulsive and relaxed than the two previous Karajan studio recordings of this symphony, midway between the speeds of the fastest 1975 version and the slowest in 1971 - yet the differences in all three timings is marginal and certainly not noticeable; the hallmark of all three of Karajan's interpretation of this symphony is the grandeur and sonority of the performance; nobody does the climax of the first movement like Karajan.Is the extra warmth of this recording perhaps the result of the stiff-backed old man letting go just a little of his famous iron control and simply letting the orchestra play music they love in the way they best know how? There is certainly no slackness in the beat or loose ensemble but you get the sense of the VPO breathing as one giant organism under the benevolent eye of a man who knew he was in the process of adding to his own already monumental legacy. The horns and violas in the principal theme of the Adagio have never sounded more hieratic or numinous and when Karajan lets the orchestra fly at 12:57 it is hard to imagine anything more transcendently, aurally glorious. The ebb and flow of Karajan&#8217;s phrasing in the finale is scarcely the work of a tired conductor whose powers were fading; indeed it is almost sprightly and the climax of the whole symphony is simply marvellous in its majesty.Like several previous reviewers, I am familiar with and greatly esteem the earlier recordings but for me this one has the edge in terms of beauty of sound.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41X18SP9ZEL._SX300_.jpg

For a proper account of both, I advise a perusal of Stewart Crowe's expert and comprehensive review; I would merely point out that these are not the full ballet scores - obviously, given their duration - but special arrangements made by the composer to be recorded in the very limited &#34;window of opportunity&#34; he was granted by his Soviet masters at the height of the Cold War.These are not the only great recordings; Tjeknavorian, Simonov and Khachaturian himself made other very recommendable versions but there is a special magic conferred on this one by the excellence of the re-mastered sound, the virtuosity of the VPO in full cry and the occasion itself. Especially striking is the warmth and colour of the strings and the reedy, plaintive woodwind of that orchestra in that era. There is such an explosive, percussive quality to the fast music that you realise how much the composer picked up from Stravinsky; then the syncopated, tango rhythms recall Gershwin; finally, the swooning melodiousness of the love music reminds you that the Armenian Khachaturian was trained in the Moscow Conservatory and very familiar with Tchaikovsky - yet his voice is all his own, instantly recognisable.This is one packed disc, its 80 minutes made up by the addition of Glazunov's &#34;The Seasons&#34; in a recording made late in his career by Ernst Ansermet, which doesn't strike me as either the best match or the best recording; it is rather rushed and charmless and the orchestra not the sweetest in tone. Still, it&#8217;s good, if not great; people won't be buying this recording for that but rather for the two stupendous suites.There is just a little analogue tape hiss; otherwise the range and depth of the 24-bit re-mastering is stunning.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BkWCl5AyL._SX300_.jpg

But then there is a superb recent account by Thielemann, the old de Burgos, Mehta and even Gunter Wand.Good as she is, I don't think Sylvia McNair as ethereal as some sopranos but her floated high notes are very satisfying and I find both Hagegard and Aler to be unsurpassed in their roles, the former combining lower register heft with a beautifully controlled falsetto and Aler&#8217;s stratospheric singing sounding spookily beautiful. The choir are suitably energetic and the sound excellent - just a little soft-edged for me. The same might be said of Slatkin's conducting; I have often found him to lack temperament and occasionally the temperature of proceedings drops too far as becomes too careful in his beat. There is, however, frequently a kind of joy in the performance which carries over to the listener.Recorded in 1992, this can be bought for almost nothing and is certainly a version to do the piece justice, even if it's not quite the best out there.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/510gadhAabL._SY300_.jpg

Influenced by Mannheim and Paris, Mozart introduced a number of innovations and a new psychological depth into his music; this recording serves those improvements well even if it lacks what I must for want of a more precise term, call star quality; that you find in other recordings like the live 1978 Covent Garden performance under Colin Davis with Janet Baker, Stuart Burrows and Yvonne Kenny or the 1971 RAI broadcast, again under Davis with a young Jessye Norman and Heather Harper. However, the latter also has Nicolai Gedda as Idomeneo and I think Anthony Rolfe Johnson for Gardiner here has the edge over almost everyone else with his combination of heroic power and coloratura facility.Gardiner does not perhaps find the drama in the music that Davis brings out and having a period band does not always help him to do so, but so much here is sharp and punchy that I am loathe to moan too much. Von Otter sings beautifully with the usual touch of blandness that I find is nearly always present in her singing; the same is true of the rather characterless but vocally secure Martinpelto. Sylvia McNair does not have to be quite so gung-ho in the passive, suffering role of Ilia and her silvery soprano is a delight.Providing in an appendix the extra and alternative music Mozart cut out of the first Munich production to enhance dramatic coherence and pace is sensible and scholarly, although I might have countenanced restoring some of the best missing passages given that this is a recording and not a performance.This is certainly amongst the best things Gardiner has given us and has done its bit to rehabilitate &#34;Idomeneo&#34;; it is also a fitting memorial to Rolfe Johnson, who died from Alzheimer's at only 70 years old in 2010; his &#34;Fuor del mar&#34; is superb.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517bjFlCHnL._SY300_.jpg

Of course, the centrepiece here is the now famous Stabat Mater although for all the beauty of Sara Mingardo's deep, resonant, plaintive contralto some will prefer it performed by a countertenor, properly the voice for which was written. If so, I would advise purchase of any of the recordings from James Bowman, way back in 1977 through to the young Adreas Scholl or, more recently, David Daniels (my own favourite),Nonetheless, Mingardo sings with such expressiveness and devotion that I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed by her version. Much of Vivaldi's music stands accused of having a certain &#34;sewing machine&#34; sameness about it and furthermore, music which is supposed to be devotional in character often simply sounds too perky to be reverential - enough to make Rossini's liturgical music look positively pietistic. The opening Concerto for the Solemnity of San Lorenzo falls into that category but it must be remembered that the pleasure-loving Venetian public loved their feasts and celebrations and piety can encompass that side of faith, too.However, apart from the stark grief of the Stabat Mater, the little &#34;Concerto funebre&#34; also impresses with its solemn, sombre sonorities, somehow reminding me of Mozart's Masonic Funeral Music. There are some especially striking passages in the Largo where the woodwinds flutter or sigh over ostinato chords or a ground intoned by the lower strings.Yes, as ever in Vivaldi there are patches of journeyman stuff here but so much else is a delight.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4103XY74XTL.jpg

Besides, how likely is it that Suvi Raj Grubb would have made a mono recoding for EMI in 1971? The sound is typical of warm 60's stereo and these are grand, serious, beautifully played performances which bring out the interior voices in Haydn's scoring owing to the lucidity and perfect balance of Klemperer's disposition of his instruments - including, of course, the famous division of the first and second violins and the prominence of the woodwind, Tempi are relatively slow but everything is played with such elegance and affection that the slow movements do not limp or drag. Hearing this music as &#34;old and tired&#34; is, I think, a classic example of projecting a pre-conceived idea onto what is actually there; these are lovely renderings of the music per se but also a memento of the kind of sonority Klemperer achieved with a great orchestra; the playing is a delight.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61nP%2BrMp10L._SY300_.jpg

It is unashamedly, unabashedly operatic and thus very different from any other Requiem; its closest relative is in fact Mozart's when it comes to the prominence and emotive nature of the soloists' contribution.The emotions here are so very human: terror, shame and supplication; I have no problem with Solti's approach, especially when it is delivered by such a secure and spirited orchestra and choir; Margaret Hillis's Chicago Symphony Chorus is simply the best I know in this work. Despite some apparent vocal disparity, this is a very homogeneous team of soloists, too: Baker and Price work very well together in the Recordare and are at least as unified as Solti's earlier team of Sutherland and Horne. Baker's mezzo should be a size to small but such is the concentration of her tone and the weight of her phrasing - admittedly taking her to the limits of her lovely voice - that she produces a moving and plaintive account of her music; her pianissimi are very effective and she has enough power to hold her own in the ensembles.I am mystified by criticisms of that great and under-valued tenor Veriano Luchetti, who seems to me to deliver here one of the very best and most heroic accounts of this very difficult tenor role. He has a lovely tone, is tender and restrained in the Ingemisco and the Hostias - very far from &#34;leather-lunged&#34;, his timbre quite often sounding similar to that of Villazon. Van Dam is noble, steady and beautiful of voice, really showing off the black intensity and sleek legato of his sonorous bass, even if low notes can be submerged.The real problem is Leontyne Price's swooping and the competition of her younger self for Karajan, in what is for me the best recording of all in the La Scala version for Karajan on DVD. Yes; her voice has become at times a tad screechy and the low notes are cloudy, yet set against modern exponents she shines by virtue of the amplitude of her tone and the fact that she really sounds as if she is imploring the Almighty for mercy. Her &#34;sed signifer&#8221;, her floated B flat in the &#34;Libera me&#34; and her concluding top C are all mightily impressive. There are blowsy moments but she is still in command of both her voice and the role; some of the &#34;swooping&#34; is portamento for expressive purposes and some just sounds a bit laboured but she remains imposing.The sound is superb: the Dies Irae bass drums are amplified by the apt acoustic of the Medinah Temple and similarly the trumpets ring out majestically. (Someone drops something metallic 7:21 in the opening Kyrie - no matter.) Solti's tempi strike me as just right; for all that I like Reiner&#8217;s marmoreal approach Solti keeps things moving better, especially at what is for me the crucial point in the Offertorio when &#34;Quam olim Abrahae&#34; is introduced and then reprised - that's where the momentum really must pick up fast and Solti knows how to do it. I also love the swing he gives the 6/8 rhythm of the opening of that movement; surely it's a mistake to attempt to sanctify this blood and thunder work by adorning it in priestly robes?Comparisons with more recent recordings by such as Muti (indifferently sung), Barenboim (graced by Jonas Kaufmann but otherwise not so very distinguished) and Pappano (really quite bland) should make us re-appreciate the virtues of this recording.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sGQBz-YhL._SX300_.jpg

Here is the wild, desperate sadness of the Russian soul transmuted by the alchemy of music into something beautiful and strange.There isn't another contralto voice like it around today and the last of comparable power and brilliance will be found amongst the likes of Schumann-Heink, Louise Homer, Dame Clara Butt and Jeanne Gerville-R&eacute;ache. Her range, both in vocal terms (more than three octaves) and of repertoire (from Baroque to Rossini to Shostakovich), mark her out as a true vocal phenomenon.All the tracks here are extraordinarily impressive but my favourite is the haunting aria &#34;The Field of the Dead&#34; from Prokofiev's great cantata &#34;Alexander Nevsky&#34;. The Shchedrin is the most unusual item here: alternately weird, chilling and blackly humorous, it provides a real vocal work-out for Podle&#347;'s special gifts. In many ways, however, the real tour de force here is Mussorgsky's four &#34;Songs and Dances of Death&#34;; Podle&#347;&#8217;s ability to colour her voice and encompass the different vocal characterisations of Death, who sings in all four songs to the mother of the sick child, to the dying consumptive girl, to the drunk peasant and as Field Marshall to the dead amid the carnage of the battlefield.She is ably accompanied by Constantin Orbelian,who seems for some time to have been the go-to conductor by operatic artists making important recital albums; he has also supported Radvanovsky, Hvorostovsky (frequently), Brownlee, Spyres, Gorchakova and Gerello. His direction here is exemplary and the sound superb.

Clearly he knows exactly what he wants to do with Bruckner here and achieves it; whether you, especially if you are a conservative or traditionalist with firm views about how Bruckner should be interpreted, will like this approach is for you to decide. Certainly there are moments of limpid beauty in this recording but I'm not sure that is enough.It is not just speed that is the issue; at around an hour Herreweghe's certainly one of the fastest performances on record, but in the good company of William Steinberg, Heinz R&ouml;gner and even Knappertsbusch. However, the latter had the advantage of directing the VPO, just as R&ouml;gner had the Berlin Radio Symphony in its heyday and all are distinctly more flexible than the rather metronomic Herreweghe. He has an orchestra of only 76 instrumentalists playing on gut strings and replica period instruments without much vibrato and thus distinctly underpowered at key points.Hence the opening has little glow or tension about it; instead of hearing the stirrings of a big beast in that hesitant thrumming of that opening theme, we are almost listening to the town band run through a practice exercise and we lack the sense of building essential to Bruckner long, arcing conceptions. Thus the first movement jog-trots without the requisite variation in weight of sound or dynamics and the impact of the chorale is diminished. To be fair, the conclusion is ethereal but so delicate as to fail to gather momentum and the climax disappoints.Similarly, the stern prophet's voice which opens the Adagio is muted by the lack of vibrato and the strings' line bulges and whines for the same reason. The melody literally cannot sing because the orchestra is doing the instrumental equivalent of humming. Nonetheless, the music itself is so beautiful and the playing so dedicated, with fine intonation, that they almost get away with it. Once gain again, however, the climax fails to overwhelm; compensation comes in the form of the ravishing horn and Wagner tuba playing over the last minute or so.The Scherzo is pretty foolproof in the hands of any decent conductor and Herreweghe captures its mood without it sounding exactly demonic. The Finale constitutes the greatest disappointment; there simply isn't enough caressing of the music in the quiet passages and the big, bombastic utterances in march time are prosaic.What is Bruckner if you deliberately underplay his Romanticism and spirituality? Certainly not what he intended us to understand him to be. This is an interesting experiment in re-thinking his most popular symphony but not one, I think, which ultimately honours his spirit.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51X5XFJX26L._SY300_.jpg

One here tells us that Karajan's conducting is old, tired and without energy and another that we should skip Kathleen Battle's contribution as she has a nasty voice and no idea of Viennese style. It's still a free country (more or less) but never have such people made a better case for censorship - except that it's probably more effective to let their inanities stand as self-condemning. I&#8217;d love to apply the blind-listening test to the former to demonstrate a water-tight exemplar of someone hearing what they intended to - the other one simply needs a hearing aid.Anyway, to business; it is touching how that complicated and immensely gifted old ego-maniac von Karajan finally got the offer to guest-conduct a Viennese New Year's Eve concert when he was ill and ailing and always in pain from his back injury - yet you would hardly guess that from the lilt, lift and spring of these performances of a medley of the Strauss family's loveliest melodies. Boundless energy and aggression are hardly required in such music; rather wit, charm and delight are in order. Karajan and the VPO are clearly enjoying themselves. Just before listening to this, I played another famous New Year's Eve concert recording from Berlin in 1992 with Abbado at the helm of the BPO; that is also a glorious affair but rather more serious than this one, being dedicated to the works of the other Strauss. This recording is all smiles. Pace the previous malcontent, it is hard to imagine a prettier, more beguiling lyric-coloratura soprano than Battle's and how she is inappropriate stylistically beats me; for eight minutes she trills, skims, swoops and soars as if she hadn't a care in the world, always dead on the note and scarcely an aspirate within earshot (well, almost nary a one..).The centrepiece of any such concert must be the &#34;Blue Danube&#34; and it is gloriously played here, with the requisite Schmaltz and affection. The audience participation in the Radetzky March is unusually scrappy but it matters not; this is sheer fun.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61M1h%2BaEBTL._SY300_.jpg

There have been a few others, including one in Washington Cathedral and two live recordings by Muti but the first was in fact on the 5th October 1993 in the V&eacute;zelay basilica, two days after Gardiner performed this for the first time since 1827 in St Petri, Bremen. Thus Philips is being a tad disingenuous marketing this as a &#34;World Premiere Recording&#34;, as they were beaten to it by a week, but they are correct in marketing it as the first recording made under &#34;studio&#34; conditions, even if it was in fact made in Westminster Cathedral, which provides an ideal acoustic thanks to good engineering.None of this much matters, I suppose; let's simply welcome the re-emergence of this fascinating music. No-one is a greater fan of Berlioz than I; his music has always struck a chord with me in a way that I know eludes some music-lovers, but I think previous reviewers have rather gone overboard in praising this as a &#34;youthful masterpiece&#34;. Berlioz knew what he was doing when he jettisoned it and although I am glad to hear the piece it really is a bit disjointed despite its incidental beauties. It is in fact impossible for the seasoned Berlioz lover to listen this recording without tune-spotting and it is certainly true that Berlioz demonstrated excellent judgement in his selection of what to recycle in later, greater works. For example, the Credo is a lumbering affair, not helped by Cachemaille's rather laboured and effortful singing; he tends to growl in the lower regions and is straining in his declamatory passage in the Resurrexit, too. Jean-Luc Viala brings a mellifluous tenor to the long melody of the &#34;Agnus Dei&#34;. Donna Brown sings prettily in the Incarnatus.The score bears many of the hallmarks of Berlioz's highly idiosyncratic, literally unschooled style but his originality has not yet been disciplined or integrated into a sufficiently unified idiom to prevent the listener feeling rather lost and directionless, there are so many strange twists and abrupt departures within movements. Some effects are startling - sudden blasting chords or rhythmic volte-faces - some impressive - the trumpets in the Resurrexit - and some merely crude, bombastic or inappropriate, such as the jaunty melody there much more aptly reworked later in &#34;Benvenuto Cellini&#34;.

Yet look again, and you will divine just how rigid and narrow-minded are its detractors who &#34;know&#34; how Rameau &#34;was&#34; and &#34;should be&#34; played. The comment that really made me laugh was the observation that this is how Liberace would play it; it should be entered into a competition for sheer absurdity.If you cannot hear Barto's musicality or technical mastery, more's the pity - for you, that is. Barto is clearly not in any sense attempting to replicate traditional or conventional ideas of Baroque style; the only issue is, is what he does enjoyable and musical? Again, if you think not, fine; that's your privilege but what a world of pleasure you instantly banish.I discovered Rameau from a double bargain-bin LP in downtown New York in the mid 80's. It was, of course, Marcelle Meyer playing her monster Pleyel on the French EMI R&eacute;f&eacute;rences import and I was instantly captivated. Since then, I have been unable to shake off the malimprinting resulting from exposure to those performances and nothing since has absorbed me, least of all the dry little efforts on harpsichord - until this disc, which opens up new horizons and had me revisiting Rameau's keyboard music with fresh ears.Stylistically, it is essentially rhapsodic, idiosyncratic, improvisational and, well, all of over the place. But that's the point: it's a blatant, deliberate act of wilfulness springing from love of the music rather than self. Barto's range of colour and variety of touch  is extreme and his application of pedal excessive but it's not as if everything he does is neither deliberate nor conscious; he clearly manufactures exactly the effects that he wants. Like all the best pianists, the result is often vocal, a duet between two manual voices in duet, with the modern piano permitting suspended or lingering harmoniesThis is the kind of playing that replicates the shock Glenn Gould produced in his treatment of Bach yet I suspect it could achieve the same of kind of cult status as Gould's two Goldberg recordings - and certainly replicate the same phenomenon of introducing a new audience to Rameau's wonderfully fertile and melodic invention. Nobody is pretending this is in any sense authentic - nor do we have to. What is authentic, however, is the Barto's love of, and reverence for, the beauty of the music.I am grateful to previous reviewer Quinton Fox, whose review - the product of a much more sophisticated and informed pianistic sensibility than mine - first tipped me off to the pleasures of this recording.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IEExd3ZtL._SY300_.jpg

Nor is he by any means always ponderous, as even a cursory listen to the propulsive finale of the Second will confirm. The First and Fourth are also highly recommendable, even if I don't think Klemperer brings quite enough drive either to the opening of the former or the finale of the latter in comparison to touchstone performances by Furtw&auml;ngler from wartime and the early fifties. Still the horns blare from the hillsides towards the end of the Allegro finale to the Fourth like an angelic cohort descending on the foe.A special refined pleasure is derived from being able to hear, either on speakers or especially on headphones, how Klemperer deployed the strings in the old manner, with the second violins on the extreme right where the double basses are in a modern orchestra; this emphasises Brahms' contrapuntal effects and enlivens the aural palette.Most old hands will have many if not all of these classic recordings but at this price this box set is worth acquiring either to get these works in the newly remastered sound or to flesh out any gaps in the collection - such as the twelve and a half minute gem the &#34;Alto Rhapsody&#34; with Christa Ludwig in most flexible and voluptuous voice.",4.0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514mHXYqsWL._SY300__PJautoripBadge,BottomRight,4,-40_OU11__.jpg"

Munch conveys a sense of being on the edge without losing control; we understand that this much abandonment is both exhilarating and terrifying, especially as those brass whoop to a close.The Pavan could hardly present more of a contrast; although Munch refuses to linger, the poise and legato of James Stagliano's horn solo in combination with the reedy, French-style woodwinds create a flowing pastoral idyll rather than a still-life.Of course, most new buyers will be looking for Bolero and they won't be disappointed, but older hands will relish the more subtle charms of the two suites, displaying Ravel's genius for sonically painting scenes and Munch's gift for realising them. There is a nice contrast between the naive tenderness of the fairy tale and the sultry sophistication of the Spanish scenarios. Neither for sound nor interpretation does Munch necessarily eclipse the classic accounts of this repertoire by Jean Martinon and Fritz Reiner, both with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and both recorded for RCA in the h50's and 60's respectively - what a catalogue that label had! - but I want all three.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51PivVY7pNL._SY300_.jpg

Opera's most dysfunctional family is given some utterly astonishing music and for all that I recognise a degree of conscious artifice in Strauss's determined modernism, I find this opera wholly absorbing.Having just listened again to the superb Sinopoli recording, I wanted immediately to re-visit this classic version from Solti. The sound is almost as good as the modern digital set and I was instantly struck by the quality of the five singers who sing the Maids, who include some famous names such as Helen Watts, Yvonne Minton and Felicia Weathers; they really lend distinction to that opening cacophony. Nilsson's steely sound does not suggest the same lascivious sensuality as Alessandra Marc's tremendous performance but the heft and brilliance of her vocalisation constitute a phenomenon in themselves.I do not enjoy Marie Collier's vibrant, even faintly tremulous Chrysothemis as much as Deborah Voigt's marvellously strong and steady assumption of the role but it is still a dramatically convincing performance; spookily, her voice is often oddly reminiscent of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Regina Resnik is not perhaps as vocally secure as Hanna Schwarz but her Clytemnestra is a tour de force of characterisation; her burnished lower register is especially thrilling, especially when it contrasts with Nilsson's pure tones.Tom Krause makes a fresher, more virile voiced Orestes than the aging Ramey's account and the imitable Stolze is ideal as the weak, neurotic Aegisthus.Solti is by no means all drive and nervous energy; he makes the most of the sinuous melody which follows Elektra's appeal to her deceased father half way through her opening tirade. Of course both his and Sinopoli's recordings have the huge advantage of the Vienna Philharmonic for orchestra.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CiQVOQgML._SY300_.jpg

It would have been lovely to have heard that most elegant and neglected of French tenors, Alain Vanzo, sing the aria &#34;T'amo qual dama un angelo&#34; for Gennaro which opens the Second Act, but it is hardly reasonable to complain as that wasn't re-discovered by Richard Bonynge until 1975. You can hear it sung only by the equally wonderful Giacomo Aragall in the Decca recording with Sutherland. As compensation, Vanzo does sing his concluding aria &#34;l'estremo anelito&#34; which is missing in the recording the same conductor, Jonel Perlea, made for RCA a year later with Caball&eacute;. It is again a pity that in that recording Alfredo Kraus's reedy tenor was substituted for Vanzo, who was criminally ignored by the big recording companies in the 60's and 70's.The other consideration is that of course while the two excellent studio recordings are in good, analogue stereo, this is only in clean mono, with a bit of crackle and thump from the original tape which has not been subjected to any remastering by Opera d'Oro, as is their wont. Still, the original sound is certainly good enough; the audience is fairly quiet apart from deservedly vociferous roars of applause. I thought this was concert performance, so I don't quite know why Caball&eacute;'s voice goes off mike in the final duet as Gennaro is dying, but otherwise the sound is very satisfactory. Perlea hums, sings and groans along very audibly and the prompter plays a starring role; ah, well.Montsy is in simply magnificent voice in the plenitude of her youthful powers (she was 32); remember: this is now a historical recording nearly fifty years old. At one point in the ensemble which concludes Act One she holds a floated A flat for a full twenty seconds and her coloratura, legato top Cs and dynamics are all phenomenal. One can only imagine the impact of hearing her for the first time - I wasn't there!The supporting cast is of really first class quality, too; Kostas Paskalis is firm and villainous and Jane Berbi&eacute; better than I have ever heard her as Maffio Orsini.Verdi must have listened intently to the finest passages in this opera as it has all the thrust and intensity of his early and middle-period works. This is a recording which all opera fanciers will want to own and it's available very reasonably via the trusty Opera d'Oro label.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31PFJCH2K3L.jpg

It is full of the most extraordinary energy and joie de vivre without resorting to the kind of forced jollity which mars some recordings. The cast is full of Viennese regulars who often swapped roles; thus we here Erich Kunz as Frank here in 1963 but he also sang Falke for Karajan in 1955 and played Frosch for him in 1960 before reprising Frank for B&ouml;hm in 1972; Eberhard W&auml;chter here sings Eisenstein (properly a tenor role), sang Frank for Karajan and would again sing Eisenstein for B&ouml;hm. Adele Leigh might not be quite as seductive as Schwarzkopf, Gueden or, especially Gundula Janowitz but she is delightful and certainly does nothing wrong. Luxury casting is George London as Falke and Sandor Konya as Alfred; Anneliese Rothenberger is the best of all Adeles. More controversial is Ris Stevens as Orlovsky, whose exaggerated masculinity is really rather grotesque but she is far preferable to the likes of Rebroff if not as easy on the ear as Fassbaaender.The bonus of excerpts in English would in itself be well worth having even without the wonderful complete work, particularly for Anna Moffo's creamy, alluring Rosalinde but Jeanette Scovotti and Richard Lewis are also superb.

Its only rivals are the playing of the Bayreuth orchestra in Karajan's famous, live, 1952 recording but of course the sound there is comparatively wretched in the former and the 1972 studio recording does not enjoy the clarity of digital technology.I was virtually bullied into buying this CD by a fellow Amazonian and I have no complaints about his coercion; this is stupendous music-making and should be sent off on the next Voyager probe to alert extra-terrestrials to the existence of the finer things our grubby and tirelessly murderous little race is capable of producing.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21SA1R38F2L.jpg

Stephen Hough is, in terms of both technique and artistry, certainly one of the best pianists before the public today and this recording will be welcomed; indeed, it seems to be one of the few new releases making encouraging sales at present.However, I wonder if, in the context of previous great recordings, it is quite as special as some claim. It must compete with versions on my shelves of the First by Rubinstein (with Reiner), of the Second by Gilels (again, with Reiner) and by Richter (with Leinsdorf), and, in both concertos, van Cliburn (yet again with Reiner), Kovacevich (with Davis) and Gilels (with Jochum) - and that's some competition.For all his clarity and fluency, I don't think Hough quite matches those artists for drive, power and brilliance - although the opening of the D minor is certainly arresting enough and Wigglesworth directs with real momentum, while allowing Hough space for rubato and shapely phrasing. But it is soon apparent that the Mozarteumorchester is not the BPO, the LSO or the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and at times they sound a little tonally grey and under-powered for such titanic music.Nonetheless, I like and enjoy these performances; there is too much going for them to merit any other reaction - it's simply that they are not quite the very best ever made.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/617DNtVbwxL._SY300_.jpg

However, it is precisely its lack of risk-taking which for me makes it a lesser event than this stunning tour de force, played by one of the best Mahler orchestras without the flaw that afflicts the live Berlin recording. For some, the typically thin, &#34;glassy&#34;, early digital sound and a certain degree of artificial highlighting of instrumental groups was an issue; I cannot hear that in my version from the DG box set, although I see no indication of a remastering having been effected.Of course, the main gripe has been Bernstein's supposedly etiolated tempi, especially in the first and last movements; the middle movements are decidedly propulsive. While I objected to the lack of momentum in his DG &#34;Resurrection Symphony&#34;, I am here enthralled by the intensity and control Bernstein exercises over his orchestra and the phrasing of the music. I do not share the view that the opening movement fragments. He depicts with extraordinary sensitivity the final stutterings in the symphonic heatbeat as the soul takes flight and finds a still beauty in the musical recreation of death.It's not to everyone's taste but I love it - and it's pure Bernstein, like no other recording.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21FG1D0CMML.jpg

I am full of praise for the tonal variety and range of colour Jessye Norman brings to her characterisation of the teenage &#34;Ungeheuer&#34;. She can wheedle, cajole, affect navet&eacute;, lighten her big tone delicately then call on ringing power and generally encompass every emotional nuance to depict Salome; her vocal acting before the apparition of the Baptist's head is a tour de force and in many ways hers is the most successful impersonation I know. There is no stately restraint here; she takes risks and throws herself into the part in a way that she could not do on stage owing to her physical limitations of build. Her top notes shine and her lower register is trenchant without her ever sounding matronly.Similarly, I love Richard Leech's Narraboth, which is youthful, ardent and mellifluous, fully conveying his hopeless obsession with the poisonous princess. Kerstin Witt's big, hard-voiced Herodias is powerfully vocalised and suitably scornful.The supporting cast is generally mediocre but my main reservations centre on the Herod, the Jochanaan and Ozawa's conducting. The Dresden Staatskapelle is mellow and melodious but sometimes the direction is so slack as to sound enervating, undercutting the tension at key moments and turning Salome's dance into a faintly titillating sashay instead of the orgy it should be. The playing aspires to grandeur but is often dull and dutiful, in the worst Ozawa mode, eschewing thrills.About the Herod, sung by the (to me, unknown) hoarse-voiced tenor Walter Raffeiner, opinions are divided. He certainly sounds unhinged but spends so much time barking, howling and growling that the part is barely sung and he emerges quasi-voiceless.Which leaves the Jochanaan. I have never much warmed to James Morris's nasal baritone but he was here in his best period. He lacks the sonorous resonance of Van Dam, Terfel, Milnes and Waechter but sounds suitably fervent and upright without really tickling my ears - in other words, OK but not really virile..Some hear this &#34;Salome&#34; as a vehicle for Norman which fails to cohere but I can see myself listening again and again to her purple passages simply to relish her virtuosity and beauty of sound even if I skip other sections.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411R42Y9J4L.jpg

His hands seem to float over the keys and he eschews any over-emphatic gestures, relying instead on his legendary touch and ability to colour his tone. Thus the minor-key episodes in the Adagio of the Haydn sonata - the emotional heart of the piece and indeed of the recital as a whole take on a gnomic profundity entirely different from the fleet, singing runs which characterise the pretty little minuet Finale. &#34;Singing&#34; is the key word, as, more than any other pianist, Horowitz conveys the pianistic equivalent of vocalism in his playing.He was renowned for his kinship with Chopin's music but some of the pieces here are subject to some eccentric artistic choices, as in his quirky treatment of the E minor &Eacute;tude but one man's quirkiness is another's evidence of giving the music true, individual personality. Both Nocturnes are wonderfully serene. The Mazurka is light and fluid; the music dances. The Fantaisie-impromptu, too, is extraordinary in its fluency; it's the micro-hesitations Horowitz injects into his line during the slower three-quarter-time passages which create tension and a delicious anticipation on the part of the listener before he goes off like a rocket on the flawless runs. The sped at which he plays those, both in the A flat major Etude and the Fantasy is quite astonishing.As for Liszt's fantasies based on themes from Bach and Wagner, neither strikes me as particularly successful in pure musical terms but I don't mean that as any criticism of Horowitz's own artistry; I have never really got on with Liszt and find the Bach rather lugubrious and unvaried, and the Wagner bombastic, especially when Liszt has the pianist follow the succession of arpeggios by banging away percussively on D flat and A flat to compensate for the piano's intrinsic inability to sustain tone, but I conceded that there are other beauties along the way. But maybe that's just me; Horowitz obviously considered these worth playing so I'll shut up.Four days after recording this, Horowitz died; what a way to go, still in the plenitude of his artistic powers.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QBA35W04L._SY300_.jpg

Stokowski knew the difference between studio recordings and live performances, treating the dynamics and balances very differently, as the rehearsal clips amply demonstrate.I really enjoy those little windows on his podium style: he is authoritative but courteous, humorous but rigorous, relaxed yet demanding - and he clearly gets the best out of an orchestra willing to do his bidding and go the extra mile in terms of commitment and extravagance of expression. There are a few detectable splices and a smidgen of overload at climaxes but mostly this is extraordinarily rich and full sound.Most &#34;serious&#34; collectors have an obligatory or dutiful recording of this work and rarely play it, thinking of it as somehow rather tired or vulgar; mine has long been an excellent bargain version by the Philharmonia under Batiz on Naxos, but of course it only takes a wizard like Stokowski to remind us what a splendid tour de force this work is; Batiz, by comparison, is indeed a little stiff and restrained. I have not heard every one of the six recordings Stokowski made but as long as you enjoy the aural landscape on offer, I could not imagine that you'd find any better. Stokowski is at his least interventionist when it comes to tinkering with the orchestration and his love and knowledge of the music shines through.The musical bonus, in addition to the rehearsals, is the live recording, preceded by Stokowski's spoken introduction, at his 90th birthday concert in 1972, playing &#34;Marche Slave&#8221;. He and the LSO give a technicolor performance and the bass is stronger on this track than in the Rimsky-Korsakov, which remains a little treble-biased.Bravo, Cala!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417SZF15PAL.jpg

He is possessed of an extraordinary richness of tone yet able to soar into the stratosphere without any hint of shrillness; I cannot remember a more grateful sound since I first encountered Nathan Milstein and find myself playing his Adagio here over and over again. His mellow sound is complemented by simply ravishing playing from the Vienna Philharmonic under Daniel Harding, who, as with his recent Mahler Tenth Symphony, tends not to impose any great personality on the music but instead lets his orchestra play as they are used to, with a relaxed, glowing warmth and plenty of rubato. Previous reviewers - not those who fail to recognise the beauties of this wonderful recording but those more appreciative - remark upon the detail which emerges despite the plushness of sound; this has much to do with the superlative engineering and the combination of delicacy and power in this partnership. The finale is both weighty and joyous - a difficult balancing act triumphantly achieved here.Its companion piece is a daring act of faith. I readily admit to being puzzled and even repelled by Berg's chromatic, twelve tone creation and repeated playing has not reconciled me to its essentially dour sound-world. Capuon and Harding certainly play it with as much nuance and dedication as its advocates could demand. I would recommend this disc purely on the strength of the Brahms; the curious or adventurous will find an aural challenge in the Berg which those with more traditional tastes like me have yet to acquire.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514jSVgANcL._SY300_.jpg
