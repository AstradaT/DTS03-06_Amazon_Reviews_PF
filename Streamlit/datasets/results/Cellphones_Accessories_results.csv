Hidden inside is an intelligent power management circuit, to charge your device at the max speed and power. In the hand, it has a nice solid feel. The body is plastic, with a high gloss, two tone color scheme of white and grey. Also, the AC prongs fold into the charger, which makes it easier to carry in the pocket (less scratches on you leg).This charger plugs directly into the wall, which might be a hang up for some. I do not see this as problem since I am able to charge all my devices at the same time in one location. Before this charger, I would have to charge devices all over the house, now those dreadful memories are a thing of the past.Before use, be sure to read the back of the charger and see what port you need for the device you are needing to charge. You can charge up to four devices at the same time, but the maximum overall output will limited to 4A. This can be seen as a gift or curse, to me it is a gift. Being able to charge a diverse group of devices is a great thing.I use this single charger on my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, Galaxy Note 2, Smartwatch, and Bluetooth headset all at the same time. Now all of my devices are all in one place being charged, which is much easier.This is a must have charger if you have multiple mobile devices!CONTENTS:EasyAcc Quad Port Wall ChargerUser ManualFEATURES:Input: 100-240VOutput: DC 5V/4.0A Max (Even When All Ports In Use)USB Output Ports: Port 1 5V/1.3A, Port 2 5V/1.A, Port 3 5V/2.1A, Port 4 5V/2.1Dimension: 2.99 x 2.24 x 1.14in (76 x 57 x 29mm)Weight: 3.7oz (105g)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/310rm6hVBrL._SY300_.jpg

This microphone allows for clean crisp phone conversations. The only thing missing is a volume control.The design of this product has been well planned and thought out. The tangle resistant cord, enhanced bass makes for a great audio experience. When on the go, everything can be packed way into the carrying case, and tossed into a pocket of purse.The best part is the over the ear hook, that holds them firmly in place.Contents:Sharkk In-Ear Headphones w/ MicrophoneEar Tips: 3 Pair (Small, Medium, Large)Carrying CaseFEATURES:Ear Mold: Comfortably Fits The Shape Of Your EarOver Ear Hook: YesInline Microphone: Make Voice CallsDriver: 10mm Ultra High PerformanceI was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Gd1LotVuL._SY300_.jpg

I used the headphones with my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; tablet, and they worked very well. They paired easily with the Kindle Fire with the device name &#34;RevJams&#34; with no code required. To evaluate the audio quality of headphones and speakers, I have a music playlist that I use for pushing them to their limit. My acid test for bass sounds is drummer Mike Wilson's awesome two-minute drum riff in the Surfari's &#34;Wipe Out.&#34; Even at an earsplitting maximum volume, it sounded great, with no distortion or muddiness. To give my ears a break, I played some softer vocal stuff like Jim Croce's &#34;Photographs and Memories.&#34; The RevJams passed my tests with flying colors. There's an audio cable included for non-Bluetooth audio devices. (The 42&#34; flat cable is very limp, and it appears to be less prone to kinking and tangling.)The headphones are lightweight (5 ounces), and the adjustable headband gave a perfect fit for me. The cushions on the ear pieces have enough padding to be comfortable even after almost an hour on my ears. The headphones fold up into a compact size (about 6&#34;x4&#34;) for storage in a cloth pouch (included).The controls on the right side (volume, pause, advance, and back) are small raised buttons that are easy to feel and operate, which isn't always the case with headphones. To check the Bluetooth range, I walked around the house, and with line of sight, the range was at least 30 feet; with a couple of interior walls of my house between the headphones and the audio source, the signal was still solid with only a few dropouts at about 25-30 feet.I seldom use my Android cellphone, but I paired it with the headphones, and it was fine for hands-free calling, with good volume and clarity. The headphones have a small microphone on the bottom of the right side for phone calls.I charged the headphones' internal battery overnight using an AC adapter with an output of 5V~1.5A, and the included 40&#34; charging cable. The manufacturer states that the speaker will play for up to 8 hours on a full charge.Overall, I'm impressed with the RevJams Xec headphones, with their comfort, excellent audio quality, and reliable Bluetooth connection.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41j4OVoa0AL._SY300_.jpg

It's a good one, although it lacks some of the features that other comparable speakers often have. To test the speaker, I used a playlist on my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; tablet. The speaker quickly paired as device &#34;Sabrent BYTA&#34; with no code required. Music sounded very good, and lyrics were clear. Instrumental songs were also good, with decent bass sound for such a small speaker.The speaker does not have some of the features that other portable speakers often have. There are no volume, run/pause, and forward/back controls on the speaker - those must be controlled from the audio source. Also, the speaker cannot be used for hands-free cellphone calls. If the audio source has no Bluetooth, an audio cable (included) can be used to connect the speaker with the source if the source device has a 3.5mm audio jack. In the hardwired mode, the volume and track controls must be set from the source (this is always the case with any Bluetooth speaker, however). The specs indicate that the usable range of the speaker is 10 meters (33 feet) from the source. I found this to be fairly accurate, although I did notice an occasional brief hiccup at distances less than 33 feet.The speaker has a built-in rechargeable battery that when fully charged will give 5-6 hours of play, according to the user guide. (The product description page shows up to 10 hours, a discrepancy.)  I recharged the speaker with a 5V~0.85A AC wall charger overnight, and it worked fine.One very appreciated feature is the rubber-coated steel lanyard with a locking carabiner clip. This would be good for hanging the speaker or for attaching the speaker to your belt. Either way, it's not going anywhere.With 2 watts of output sound, the Sabrent speaker won't replace a boom box for big sound, but for lesser needs, especially in damp, humid conditions, the speaker would be a good choice if you don't mind controlling the sound from the audio source, since the speaker lacks audio controls.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LpCmnTvML._SY300_.jpg

The cable is USB 2.0, which has a theoretical maximum transmission speed of 480 Mbit/s (60 MB/s). For most of my needs, USB 2.0 speeds are satisfactory, but if you regularly transfer very large files between USB 3.0 devices, you need a USB 3.0 cable to achieve USB 3.0 speed.The cable appears to be well made and durable enough to last through many cycles of plugging and unplugging.

It's possible to place the back in any position, however, but in the non-locking positions, it could possibly rotate if bumped hard enough.I used the stand with my smartphone and my Kindle Fire HDX 7&#34; tablet. My smartphone is in a thick rubberized case that would not fit in the curved slot at the base of the stand, but it did sit securely on top of the slot. My tablet is in a slimline cover, and when I opened the front cover, the tablet and the back cover slid nicely into the slot. Both the phone and the tablet worked well in both the portrait and landscape orientation. With some tablets, it may be necessary to remove them from a cover for them to fit in the slot.Note that I only tested the stand with a typical sized smartphone and a 7&#34; tablet. The stand appears to be heavy enough and sturdy enough to work with larger tablets without tipping over, but I was not able to test a larger tablet.This is a very handy stand for cellphones and tablets.

I charged three devices simultaneously in the charger: a Kindle Fire HD in the 2A port, a portable battery in one of the 1A ports, and a smartphone in the other 1A port. The Kindle Fire was running a video, and the smartphone was going through a music playlist, but both devices as well as the portable battery steadily increased their charge during the two hours that they were plugged in to the charging station.This is the first AC charger I've used that has more than two output ports, and with a scarcity of electrical outlets in our old house, it's a welcome feature. Also, all of my other AC chargers plug directly into a wall outlet, whereas the 5' power cord gives a lot of flexibility in locating the charging station. (Note: The product description mistakenly lists a 6' cord).The charging station appears to be solidly built and durable enough to give good service for a long time. I'm very pleased with its performance.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xt8VtlQTL._SX300_.jpg

The Incredisonic Sound Block 100 is one I think I'll remember, however. Its size (6.2&#34;x2.3&#34;x1.8&#34;) and weight (10 ounces) make it very portable, but it's big enough to pump out a lot of sound. The specs don't list the audio output, but after listening to the speaker at maximum volume, my guess is around 3-4 watts. And unlike most portable Bluetooth speakers, the audio is in stereo. The two internal speakers are about 3&#34; apart, which is enough to discern the independent audio channels with the speaker placed close to you. I checked the speaker's audio with a playlist that I use for this purpose. Two of my favorites - Kenny Loggins' &#34;Danger Zone&#34; and The Surfaris' instrumental song &#34;Wipe Out&#34; - sounded super. Drummer Ron Wilson's continuous drum riffs in &#34;Wipe Out&#34; sounded especially good, and that's one of my deal-breakers for a speaker. I checked the stereo channels with a stereo set-up MP3, and they were spot on.The Sound Block 100 paired easily with my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; as device &#34;SB-100&#34; with no code required. With a direct line of sight, the effective range was at least 30 feet; moving around inside the house, with interior walls between the speaker and the audio source, the range was sometimes a bit less. Hardwired with the included 40&#34; audio cable, the sound was equally good, but in this mode, the volume and forward/back/pause must be controlled from the source (that's the case with any wired speakers).As with almost all portable speakers, the Sound Block 100 has a built-in lithium-ion rechargeable battery. The speaker kit includes an AC adapter/charger with a charging cable (that's a nice touch, since many speakers require you to supply your own charger).I was very impressed with the Sound Block 100. It's attractive enough to sit in your living room or wherever else you use it, the audio quality is very good, and it's one of the few portable Bluetooth speakers I've seen that has stereophonic sound.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wb1z40ekL._SX300_.jpg

It looks durable enough that I doubt it would be damaged if a truck ran over it. This is a bare-bones charger for cellphone users who need occasional recharging while on the go; with a capacity of 2600mAh, it's not meant for heavy use.The printed instruction guide is pretty useless. The type is so small that I had to use a magnifying glass to read it. And it refers to &#34;four lights,&#34; which I assume means four LED lights that indicate the remaining charge, a system that many mobile chargers use. The problem is that the four lights aren't there. There are only two lights: a red light while the Mini 2600 is being charged, and a blue light while the Mini 2600 is recharging a cellphone or tablet.I tested the unit with my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; tablet. When I started recharging the tablet, it was showing 62% battery capacity remaining. Ninety minutes later, it was showing 96%. The Kindle Fire's battery has 4550mAh capacity, so about 1550mAh was restored by the battery charger. Assuming that the battery charger has an electrical efficiency of about 80% (typical for these devices), the battery charger has about 2100mAh capacity available when it's fully charged. So theoretically, it could provide about 50% of a full charge for the Kindle Fire. For a typical cellphone with a 1400mAh battery, it should provide at least one full recharge.So it works. But without any indicator of how much charge is remaining, you're in the dark about whether the battery charger has enough remaining capacity to recharge your cellphone or tablet. The charger does have some good points, however. It's virtually unbreakable, it's very compact (0.85&#34; diameter x 3.4&#34; long), and it's very lightweight (2.4 ounces). For light duty or occasional use, it may be all some cellphone users need.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nSUxoV1wL._SY300_.jpg

We have both been very pleased with the phones. The phone came with Android 4.2 installed, but during the drive home, both phones updated to Android 4.4.2 (Kit Kat).We love the high-res screen, the vivid colors, and the sensitivity of the screen to touches and swipes. The 10 megapixel rear camera is very impressive and simple to operate and make adjustments. The sales rep at the Verizon store migrated our phone numbers and contacts in a few minutes while we waited. He said it was simple enough that we could have done it ourselves, but my wife was trading in her old iPhone 4, so it had to be done while we were in the store. We've both made a number of phone calls with our Moto X, and so far all calls have had excellent voice quality with no dropouts.I could go on to describe other features that we like, but suffice to say that overall, I'm very pleased with my upgraded new phone, and my wife has gotten into the Android experience very comfortably.

My wife and I seldom need four charger ports, but a larger family on a driving trip could easily need four ports for their mobile devices. With each of the four ports providing up to 2.4 amps, that's enough to quickly recharge virtually any cellphone or tablet on the market today.My wife and I tried out the charger on a 45-minute drive in our Subaru Forester. I had already checked the specs for the car and knew that the 12-volt power port was limited to 120 watts. That means a maximum current of 10 Amps, which safely exceeds the maximum 9.6 Amps that the charger can deliver, so no problem there. We plugged in both of our cellphones and my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. Each of the three devices was being steadily recharged while we were driving, and I have no doubt that the charger could have handled a fourth device.The only reason I can't wholeheartedly give the charger 5 stars concerns the design of the charger. For reasons that make no sense to me, the part of the charger that slides into the car's power port (located in the dashboard) is rectangular, not the usual round shape. Because of this, the charger jiggles a bit. The metal compression spring contacts hold it in place, but on a bumpy drive or if a charging cable gets stretched, the charger could pop loose and have to be pushed in again. This didn't happen, but the charger felt loose enough that it could have. We knew that it didn't pop loose, because the white LED light remained on during the drive.If you need four fast charging ports in your vehicle, the Aleratec quad port charger should definitely be considered. I wish they had used a conventional round barrel instead of the rectangular one, but the capability of charging four mobile devices simultaneously partly makes up for the possible inconvenience of having to reseat the charger occasionally.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51beS4%2B9FNL._SX300_.jpg

However, the Sty-HD stylus has a very handy pocket clip, which the Amazon stylus lacks, as well as an opening at the top for attaching a lanyard.I have to give the nod to the Sty-HD stylus.

Portable Battery Charger, Car Charger, USB Charger, Rechargeable Battery Backup, Powerbank, USB Battery Charger (Orange)","I'm not sure about the manufacturer's claim that the Jackery Air is the world's thinnest external rechargeable battery, but it's certainly thinner than most portable battery chargers that I've used. And it's built like a brick. The all-metal case looks like you could sit on it without damaging it.After receiving the charger, I charged it overnight using a 5V~1.0A AC adapter. Then I used it to recharge my 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD. The Kindle Fire initially had a 31% charge. After 142 minutes, the Kindle Fire was charged to 100%. That's about 0.5% per minute, which is about the same speed that I've had with other 1 Amp portable chargers. The Kindle Fire has a 4400mAh battery, so if the battery was recharged 69% of its capacity, the Jackery Air provided 0.69 x 4400 = 3036mAh. Not including electrical losses, that means the 5000mAh charger had about 1964mAh remaining capacity, or 39% of its original capacity. After the charging was completed, a steady red light was indicating the charge state of the charger. According to the user guide, a steady red light means the charger had 10%-40% of capacity remaining, which agrees with the arithmetic.I can recommend the Jackery Air 5000mAh charger for anyone who has moderate needs to recharge their cellphone or small tablet while they're on the go. With a 1A output, it's not the fastest charger around, but if speed isn't a big issue, that may not matter so much to many users. Also, the Jackery has only one charging port, so it can't be used to charge two or more mobile devices simultaneously. So if you need a very fast charger with the capacity to recharge large tablets or multiple devices simultaneously, the Jackery Air 5000mAh charger is not for you. But if you have more modest needs, the charger should give at least two full recharges for most cellphones, and one full recharge for most 7&#34; tablets.I really liked the charger. It's almost exactly the same size as my Moto X, and it's thin enough that I could put my phone on top of it and hold them in one hand while using the phone and charging it at the same time. You can't do that with most chargers.A product sample was provided for review purposes.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31y9oFugQHL._SX300_.jpg

In the last year, I've seen several third-party brands that appeared to be of equal quality as Apple accessories. The Pawtec Lightning cable meets or exceeds the quality of other cables that I've seen and used. The plugs and the section where the cable meets the plug end look to be well made and very durable. The hard rubber-like plug where the Lightning end goes into the iPhone or iPad is 0.45&#34; wide, which should fit through most cases. The 3-foot length (I measured it as 39&#34;) allows enough freedom of motion to move the phone or tablet around, which is essential if you're in a vehicle with your phone charging from a power port.This is an excellent cable, and it's considerably less expensive than buying the official Apple cable.A product sample was provided for review purposes.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41qe5i2CKjL._SY300_.jpg

Note that the included cable has a Lightning plug for newer Apple products. The charger can also be used for charging older Apple products that use the 30-pin plug, but you'll need to supply your own cable.The dual USB ports of the car charger are marked &#34;2.1A Tablet&#34; and &#34;1.0A Phone.&#34; With the overcharge protection that's built into the chargers, it should be safe to plug any phone or tablet in either port. I tested the charger during a drive with a friend who has an iPhone 5, with his phone plugged into the 2.1A port. I also plugged in my Android phone, using the 1.0A port. Both phones were turned on, and both were being recharged during the drive.The kit also includes a non-slip dashboard mat as a bonus item. The mat has an adhesive back that sticks to a vehicle's dashboard so you can place a cellphone on top to keep it handy. If you decide to move the mat, it's easy enough to remove - just peel it off (it doesn't damage the dashboard). The top surface of the mat is pebbled and has enough tackiness that a phone isn't too likely to slip off, but even with my phone in a protective case, I'm not sure if I would feel comfortable enough to risk having it bounce off on a rough road. You may feel differently, however.This is a nice accessory kit for owners of newer Apple devices that use the Lightning cable, but with the proper user-supplied cables, the charger could be used with any phone or tablet.A product sample was provided to me by the seller for an honest, unbiased review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417tidaqL4L._SY300_.jpg

It's ideal for someone who needs up to two complete recharges of their cellphone. It's not ideal for someone with a 9&#34; or 10&#34; inch tablet with 3G/4G connection who uses their tablet all day without access to an AC or vehicle charger. That's the tradeoff you get when the charger is small like the LiBa with only 5600mAh capacity. On the other hand, the small size and low weight (4.6 ounces) means it's very portable and hardly noticeable in a backpack or purse.I used the fully charged LiBa to recharge my smartphone, which has a 2200mAh battery. The smartphone was at 40% when I started, and it took 108 minutes to reach 100%. The LiBa still showed 3 LEDs, which meant it still had 50-75% charge. Doing some arithmetic, my phone required 2200 x 60% = about 1320mAh from the LiBa. That would leave the LiBa with about 5600 - 1320 = 4280mAh capacity, which is 76%. So the recharge used about a fourth of the LiBa's capacity, actually a little more if electrical losses in this kind of device are factored in.The output of the LiBa is rated at 5V~1.0A. That's fine for most mobile devices, although the 1A output will take longer to recharge devices that can take up to 2A. If the charging speed is an issue, the LiBa may not be the best charger for you, depending on the device you have.So for most cellphones, if your needs aren't too great, and portability is an issue, the LiBa 5600mAh battery charger would be a good choice. For most 7&#34; tablets, you should get one full charge from the LiBa. For bigger tablets, you probably should consider a charger with more capacity and possibly a faster charging rate.A product sample was provided in return for the promise of an honest, unbiased review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412oGJkxhEL._SY300_.jpg

They look like a cross between a headset and a set of earphones, but with the flexible cable that connects the two earpieces, I'll label them as headphones. The unconventional design and the dayglo green-on-black colors will draw attention, that's for sure. They actually fit better than I expected, and they seemed to be fairly secure from slipping off, although I don't do vigorous exercise anymore, so I can't say that for sure.The headset paired easily with my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; as device &#34;BLUEVIBE AGL.&#34; The audio sounded good to my ears. I have a few MP3s that I have in a special playlist to evaluate headsets and speakers. The headset passed the test, with good sound for songs like Annie Lennox's &#34;Love Song For A Vampire&#34; (listen for the heartbeat in the background) and The Surfaris' &#34;Wipe Out&#34; with drummer Ron Wilson's continuous drum riff.The controls are on the earpieces: on the left earpiece are the skip forward and skip back controls, on the right earpiece is a single rotating wheel that does duty as the power switch, pairing switch, pause, play, and volume. It takes a little practice to learn to use them by feel, but by the end of a six-song playlist, I had it down fairly well.The headset's internal 150mAh battery can be charged from a USB port. The user guide doesn't mention using an AC adapter, but I recharged the headset from a 5V~0.85A source, and it didn't seem to mind.The headset comes with a USB charging cable, two extra sizes of earbuds, and a soft mesh carrying bag.My only reservation about the headset is how well it will stay in place during vigorous exercise. The user guide shows how to create a loop in the cable to give a tighter fit. I was able to create the loop, but the fit wasn't as good as I would like.A product sample was provided for review purposes.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41MVkmJo5SL._SY300_.jpg

It is not meant to be one that will completely charge a dead phone or charge it numerous times. It is only 2600mAh which will take my Samsung S4 from a low battery to fully charged very quickly.It does get a little warm but not necessarily too hot that I am concerned using it.It is small and rubbery with a 'key chain' end in case you need to keep it handy at all times. The only problem with that is that the power cable is not built in so you would need to keep that somewhere handy too. It does come with a USB to open ended cable with plugs for micro USB, mini USB, Apple 30 pin (old style) and Nokia which provides a way to charge it through any USB wall charger or your computer as if you flip it, it will charge your device if they use one of those plugs (or you can use your own USB cable). A power bank this size will not charge a table all the way through either and may have trouble with devices that require more output.

It is a deep black and smells like leather.It is sleek and professional looking with even white stitching accents and three card slots on the inside. There is also an additional inside pocket for a small note or emergency cash.The magnetic closure is nice and keeps the cover closed. My Samsung S4 snapped quickly into the interior built-in case and comes out with a little push from behind. The screen is completely exposed and all ports - speaker, mic, charging, camera, headset - are clearly exposed.I've been using a much bigger case before using this and can see benefits and some usage drawbacks to a flip case so it is really all about how you use your phone.A flip case is thin and neat, It not only protects the back of your phone but the glass front as well. It is professional looking and comfortable in  my hands. There is nothing to hinder access to the charging port that some bulkier cases can create.But a flip case means that if you want your phone open,  you will always have a cover to either flip over or lay flat. Taking a photo means holding the cover out to the side. If you want to put it in a car mount, you have to flip the cover over and even then it can be difficult to hold it in place. If you like to sit in a meeting and see all notifications as they come in, you'll have to keep your cover open. It will not fit into a belt clip either.So if you like the idea of a flip case, this is a really nice one. Great for a man or woman, looks professional in any business situation and will drop into a pocket, briefcase or purse without the threat of cracking or scratching the glass.Update: I just took one star off the rating because after using this for awhile, I noticed a smell coming from the pockets area. I'm not sure what it is but it smells like overheating electronics. I thought it was my phone but it isn't. I'm hoping it fades with use.I was provided a sample to test for review.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oVszvgNYL._SY300_.jpg

While they seem like they would tuck around your ear, they actually are pretty stiff and curve over your ear and around the back of your head. I found it to be a little awkward in that I could feel them there and I was always thinking that they would fall out. But, they didn't. They stayed put whether I was doing things around the house or out for a fast walk. They also don't seem to sit solidly in my ears even though I swapped out the ear buds but again, they have never actually come out. The sound is good and I was able to make calls and receive them using these.It is important to make sure that the earphones are in the correct ears and that your phone is on the right side of your body. If not, they can cut in and out a bit since the signal can have interference. I found this out the hard way on my first trial since I had my phone in my left pocket.The sound is good, it's not 'blow your socks off' amazing but it is a great quality and easy to listen to.

Fortunately, there are devices like the Amzdeal 40W 5V/8A 5-Port USB Wall Charger to charge your USB device fast.&#9654; Package Contents1 x Amzdeal 40W 5V/8A 5-Port USB Wall Charger1 x Power cord&#9654; AccessoriesThe only accessory that is included this device is a 55 inch black 2-prong power adapter. This adapter is very similar to the construction of laptop power adapters, which is good, since this adapter can be easily replaced if it ever were to be damaged. The fact that the adapter is a little over 4 feet makes this the perfect adapter in work stations. I overall like the power adapter concept, and that Amzdeal chose to not include any proprietary charging.&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Input: AC 10V-240V&#8226; Output:- 5V/7A (Max)- USB1 / 2.4A (iPad)- USB2 / 1.3A (Samsung Tab)- USB3 / 2.4A (iPad)- USB4 / 1.0A (iPhone)- USB5 / 1.0A (Android)&#8226; Size: 98mm x 60mm x 26mm&#8226; Weight: 153.5g  5g&#9654; HardwareThe product images, and typos in technical details, make this product much bigger than it really is (3.9 x 2.4 x 1 inches; 5.4 ounces). ). It is a very small and light device that you can hold in your hand like a mobile phone. This product only comes in a matt black plastic, but looks very sleek and minimalistic without being a fingerprint magnet. On the front are 5 ports with the text &#8220;2.4A, Samsung Tab, 2.4A, 1.0A, and 1.0A&#8221; over each port. I like that they include the current values for each port, but think &#8220;Samsung Tab&#8221; is a bit out of place. I understand the reasoning behind this, as tablets take more current than 1A, but think the 2.4A iPad port would be acceptable. On the left side is the Amzdeal name and logo, and on the back is the power adapter port and specifications. I overall like the build of this product, as it doesn&#8217;t look a simple USB charger with a plastic enclosure, and the fact that this is a 40W/8A wall charger means that it can withstand all the ports being used simultaneously, without needing to compromise the charge of any port.&#9654; SetupSetup doesn&#8217;t get simpler than with this device. Plug the two prong power adapter into the USB charger, and then into your wall outlet.&#9654; TestingI tested this with my Nexus 7 (2013), using Android 4.4.2 with a 3950mA battery, running no processes except system apps. I performed two tests in the 2.4A USB port, a multimeter test at the start and end, and a fast charge test to calculate the amount this device charges per an hour.Multimeter Test:The multimeter test attempts to test the voltage and current the device uses at the beginning and end of the test. Sometimes, devices remain the same current throughout the test, and sometimes the current lowers toward the end. It is nice to know if the power source is giving out less power by the end of the test. The current is the ampere the device is taking in, with max current the maximum amount of ampere the device is capable of taking in. The voltage is the amount the power source is capable of giving, with min voltage the lowest possible amount of the power source giving.&#8226; 5%Current: 0.87AVoltage: 4.98VMax Current: 0.90AMin Voltage: 4.90V&#8226; 82%Current: 1.14AVoltage: 5.00VMax Current: 1.14AMin Voltage: 4.90VThese are very high results for my Nexus 7 at this percentage. Usually, you can expect 0.40 &#8211; 0.60A, but to get a rating of almost double that amount proves the efficiency of the charger.Fast Charge Test:The fast charge test attempts to find the efficiency and performance of the power source.Time &#8211; Nexus 7 charge %7:02AM - 5%7:35AM - 21%8:21AM - 46%8:59AM - 66%9:35AM - 87%10:15AM - 97%10:25AM - 100%Nexus 7 Battery Size x Amount Charged = Total Charge3950mA * (0.95) = 3752.5mATotal Charge / Time (hours) = Charge per Hour3752.5mA/3.38h = 1110.2mA per HourThis device charges at 1110mA per an hour, which considering my OEM wall charger only charges at approximately 700mA per an hour, this is an amazingly fast result for a USB charger,. These results conclude this charger does indeed charge fast.&#9654; Final ThoughtsI am very impressed by the speed of this USB charger, as it is capable of charging my Nexus 7 at 1110.2mA pre hour. Because of these results, I recommend this device to anyone that needs a USB charger and give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ A very small, and well built device, tested to charge my device at 1110mA per hour. These are very fast results!+ 5 USB ports, capable of fully charging 4 tablets and one mobile device at one time.+ Multimeter tests showed an increase of charge over time, which makes is unusual, as the opposite results were expected. This means the device charges faster over time, instead of slower.Cons:- It is a similar design made by other companies, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a cheap knockoff either.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31PG1kQkSGL._SY300_.jpg

The Nationite SA1 Universal Phone & Tablet Micro-Suction Stand may be what you are looking for.&#9654; Package Contents&#8226; Nationite SA1 Stand&#8226; Phone Holder&#9654; HardwareThese stands come in either a black or white glossy surface, except the back of the mount, which has a matt black (or white) surface. The stand comes in one piece, with an optional phone holder to attach to the top suction pad. The base is a trapezoid shape (2.5&#8221; to 1.75&#8221; inches), with the bottom having its base suction pad, this wraps around to the 1.5&#8221; x 2.125&#8221; suction pad. These suction pads use similar technology from the green suction pad car holders, from the &#8220;As seen on TV&#8221; commercials. Unfortunately, both mounts have issues with attracting dust and dirt on their suction pads (see photos).The optional phone holder uses the same plastic material of the stand. It basically is two 0.5&#8221; half circles to hold your phone. This will attach any phone with the said thickness.The plastic material of the mount seems fairly sturdy, but it is very light. If the bottom suction pad isn&#8217;t used, then your phone can potentially be damaged. I honestly don&#8217;t approve of the design of this stand.&#9654; Set upThe instructions on the box are very vague, saying the following:1. Remove the protective film from the micro-suction pad before use (with picture of removing film from top suction pad).Unfortunately, the process isn&#8217;t as simple as the included instructions. The following instructions should be used, in addition to the above instruction.2. Remove protective film from bottom film, as in step one.3. Firmly place stand on clean surface.4. (Optional) For best results, place phone holder on top micro-suction pad.Setting up the device was mildly frustrating, because it requires edging the plastic with your fingertips; potentially damaging the suction pad. When the stand is placed in the desired area, it must remain in that spot. Removing the suction pad will ruin any future mounting (see testing).&#9654; TestingI tested this stand with my Nexus 7 (2013) and LG Optimus F6. The suction pad couldn&#8217;t mount either device with its case, leading me to use the phone holder, because I wouldn&#8217;t ever want to place my device without its protective case. Each device fit well and was able to perform tasks while mounted.I then removed the stand and placed it on another desk, making it no longer secure. My tablet and phone each fell twice while attempting to perform the same tasks. This concluded my tests with the stand.&#9654; Final ThoughtsI can&#8217;t wrap my head around using a $11.50 stand for my devices that cost hundreds of dollars. Initially the stand worked well, but removing the stand from its initial spot removed any security. For long term use, I cannot recommend this device. If you place this in one spot, I can understand this product interesting you, but I would proceed purchasing with caution. Because of my concerns, I only give this product a 3 star rating.Pros:+ As long as you mount this in one place, your device should be secured.+ Made from hard plastic, with option of phone (or tablet) holder.+ Very cheap price.Cons:- Not for long term use. When you move this from its initial spot, it won&#8217;t secure your product as well.- Suction pad isn&#8217;t thick, and overall not made well.- Base isn&#8217;t heavy enough when bottom pad adhesive is no longer sticky.- Instructions are very vague, and frustrating to set up.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fRH2BC0SL._SX300_.jpg

Everything in the packaging, from the box, to instruction manual, case, and power bank, are made from recycled material. I am impressed by the attempt made by Amzdeal.&#9654; AccessoriesThis power bank includes a 6.25&#8221; x 4&#8221; inch grey case and a 20&#8221; micro USB cable. The gray case is made of a recycled material, as it feels like it is made out of a cloth paper material, with a small pouch on the front with the AmzDeal logo and name, for your micro USB cable, and a large pouch to fit the power bank. I like that they include a case, as power banks don&#8217;t include one. The 20&#8221; micro USB cable is flat and made out of a white rubber material. Micro USB is the most common charging interface by the Android operating system today, which means there is a good chance you already have a few of these micro USB cables. This means they are easily replaceable, and you will never have to worry paying extra for proprietary connectors. I dislike that the packaging doesn&#8217;t include a power adapter though, as computer USB ports only have a max of 900mA of charge. I see this was done to cut costs.&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Input: DC 5V/1A&#8226; Output: DC 5V/2.1A&#8226; Capacity: 8000mAh&#8226; Size: 146mm x 70mm x 10mm&#8226; Weight: 180g&#8226; Lifespan:  &#62;500 times&#9654; HardwareThe device is very flat and light for a power bank (5.7&#8221; x 2.7&#8221; x 0.4&#8221;inches; 6.3 ounces). This is made possible by the fact it uses a lithium-polymer battery, which shouldn&#8217;t be confused with lithium-ion batteries. The major difference between the two is that Li-poly batteries can be credit card thin, but are more expensive and have a lower energy density. There are pros and cons to each device, but manufacturers are using lithium-ion batteries, as they are cheaper. This device comes in either white or pink. On the top body is the battery capacity of 8000mAh, battery name, and a button to activate the LED indicators on the front. The front has four blue LED indicators, and a 2.1A USB port for charging your mobile device.LED Indicators:&#8226; 1 LED: 0%-25%&#8226; 2 LED: 26%-50%&#8226; 3 LED: 51%-75%&#8226; 4 LED: 76%-100%I like that the LED indicators give approximate battery life. On the left side is the micro USB port for charging the external battery. At the bottom face is the Amzdeal name and logo, and the text &#8220;Moving Life&#8221;.  At the back is the specifications and certifications. Overall, the battery doesn&#8217;t feel cheap in any way, despite being used from recyclable material, but feel the selling point of using going &#8220;green&#8221; is redundant, as external batteries all require a power source to charge, and will each lose charge while charging mobile devices.&#9654; Setup1. Connect the USB interface of computer or power adapter (not included) to the IN interface of Power Bank.2. When the indicator lights all light up, the power bank is fully charged.&#9654; TestingI tested this with my Nexus 7 (2013), using Android 4.4.2 with a 3950mA battery, running no processes except system apps. I performed a fast charge test to calculate the efficiency and amount this device charges per an hour.Fast Charge Test:The fast charge test attempts to find the efficiency and performance of the power source. With external batteries, we can even find how efficient it is by using the battery until it goes out. For this test, I attempted to charge the mobile device twice, to get an accurate reading on the battery, however, we have to assume there will be some charge lost in the time in between tests. We should also take into consideration the loss of charge from charging one battery to another, due to the nature of how it is done; 60%-65% of the battery&#8217;s rated charge is acceptable.External Battery Size * Acceptable Charge % = Expected Charge/Nexus 7 battery size = Expected Charge %8000mAh * 0.60 = 4800mAh/3950mAh = 121% Expected ChargeTime &#8211; Nexus 7 charge %11:15PM &#8211; 3%11:39PM &#8211; 21%12:14AM &#8211; 41%12:53AM &#8211; 63%1:33AM &#8211; 86%2:15AM &#8211; 100%7:19PM &#8211; 5%7:30PM &#8211; 16%7:50PM &#8211; 28%8:20PM &#8211; 49%Nexus 7 Battery Size x Amount Charged = Total Charge3950mA * (1.41) =5596mAhTotal Charge/ Battery Size = Efficiency %5596mAh/8000mAh = 69.95%Total Charge / Time (hours) = Charge per Hour5596mAh/4h = 1392mAh per hourThis device charges at 1392mA per an hour, with a 69.95% efficiency rating. Taking into consideration the loss of charge in the 15 hours that the device wasn&#8217;t being used, and that my Nexus 7 charges at around 600-700mA per hour, these are DOUBLE those results! This is a fantastic charger, as these are one of the top results from ANY charger! I am more than satisfied by these results.&#9654; Final ThoughtsThis device may be eco friendly, but it is well designed and tested to be very fast and was efficient (1392mA per hour; 69.95% efficient). For a device to charge this amount while having a 15 hour layover period should be more than enough reasons to purchase this device. I absolutely recommend this product to anyone and give this a 5 star rating, as well as my stamp for high quality product.Pros:+ A lithium polymer battery, which has an eco friendly design, but shined best in its efficiency and fast charge tests (69.95% Efficient, 1392mA per hour).+ Uses micro USB interface, a very common interface used by cellphones.Cons:- No power adapter includedI was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21V-fKM9XoL._SY300_.jpg

Soundbot is one of these manufacturers, producing headphones like the SB270, a headset capable of wirelessly streaming music or hands-free talking.&#9654; Package Contents&#8226; SoundBot SB270&#8226; Micro USB&#8226; Male to Male Stereo Audio Cable&#8226; Instruction Manual&#9654; AccessoriesIncluded with this device is a micro USB and male to male stereo audio cable. The micro USB cable is thick but short, being 24 inches. I like that this device uses the micro USB interface, as it is the most common Android charging cable. Most Android users own micro USB cables, since it has become a standard for charging mobile devices, external batteries, and several other devices. This also includes a flat 47.5 inch male to male stereo audio cable, with gold plated connectors. The top of the cord is colored white, and the bottom of the cord is colored black. It is overall a very appealing cable.&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Music play time: 14 hours&#8226; Talk time: 12 hours&#8226; Operating range: up to 33 feet&#8226; Bluetooth standard: Bluetooth 3.0 + EDR version with AVRCP and A2DP support for hands-free talking and music streaming.&#8226; Speaker: 40mm driver speaker x 2&#8226; Charging port: 5-pin Micro USB&#8226; Minimum Charging voltage and current: 5V 200mAh&#9654; HardwareThe headphones look deceptively large on the description page, but they are much smaller (6.5 x 5 inches closed; 6.5 x 7.5 inches open). The device can come in a gray/white or black/red color scheme, where the major color would be on the headphone padding and headband, and the minor color on the headphone cover and where the headphones fold. It is overall a very sleek looking. On the left headphone casing is the power (or multifunctional) button, micro USB port (for charging), LED indicator, auxiliary port, microphone, and Volume Up and Down button.LED Indicator:&#8226; Power On: 3 Rapid blinks in blue light&#8226; Power off: 3 rapid blinks in red light&#8226; Standby: Blue light blinks once every 5 seconds&#8226; Incoming Call: Blue light blinks continuously.&#8226; In use: Blue light blinks once every 5 seconds.&#8226; Charging Mode: Red light stays on or blinks&#8226; Fully charged: Red light will turn off&#8226; Low battery alarm: Red light blinks once every 30 seconds.On the right headphone casing is the SoundBot logo. The earphones are able to be bended and closed inside the headphones, giving the most portable position possible. The earphones are also able to be flipped out, giving you the ability to hear your music while it is resting on your neck. I have absolutely no problems with the hardware of these headphones except the earpads. The earphone padding puts me in mind whenever I want to buy a new pillow. The pillow will always be fluffy when you purchase it, but as time goes, so does the pillow; this starts an endless cycle of buying more pillows. Beside the padding and being deceptively large on the Amazon profile link, I consider this the all in one package.&#9654; SetupPairing this device is fairly simple.1. Press and hold the multifunction (power) button for 7 seconds until blue and red light blink alternatively.2. Search for SB270 headset from media player device.3. Congratulations, you have successfully paired the unit.&#9654; TestingI tested this unit over the time of 3 days, or 7 hours, testing it with my Nexus 7 (2013). As stated in hardware, the padding is essentially my biggest issue with this device. During my tests, it seemed like the fluffy padding became stiffer. I assume with continual use, this will lead to uncomfortable earpads, but during the test, the earpads were very comfortable. I felt no irritation from my ears after extended use. I turned on the device by holding the power button for 3 seconds, waiting for the blue LED to blink. The headphones would automatically connect, assuming I already paired the device. I then tested this with several genres, including: rap, country, popular, rock, alternative rock, classic and rock. The sound was very clear, without any distortions, but bass was flat for low, mid, and high end. The sound quality didn&#8217;t differ from directly connecting to the stereo connector or Bluetooth. I did attempt to listen to the music on my neck with the earpads out, and found it mildly comfortable when I didn&#8217;t want to have sound blasting into my ears, but it should be noted that this is in no way replacement for speakers. The sound would be loud enough in my backyard, but in traffic. Also, it should be noted when I initially tested, the previous, next, and play/pause button would automatically change my Music tracks without being pressed, but this problem stopped after about an hour. I also never figured where the &#8220;NFC&#8221; tag on the headphones were, as the packaging claims it is compatible, but doesn&#8217;t indicate how.&#9654; Final ThoughtsIf you are transitioning from cheaper headphones to this, then you should be very happy, but if you are transitioning from high end stereo headphones, then you will clearly notice the differences. This is definitely a good stocking stuffer for your kids or budget friendly audiophiles. Because of the build quality, I only give this product a 4 star rating, but I still recommend this device to anyone needing Bluetooth headphones. If SoundBot produced a better earpad then I would consider giving a better rating.Pros:+ A budget friendly and portable Bluetooth headset, giving the ability to stream music clearly, while taking the least amount of space.+ Several media buttons for adjusting volume, powering, or answering a call.+ Easy setup and uses micro USB interface; a very common cable.Cons:- Earpads were very soft, but in time will become flat and uncomfortable.- Bass was very flat for low, mid, and high range. This was expected for a budget friendly electronic.- SoundBot advertises NFC support but provides no documentation. NFC connection was unsuccessful.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41xxwhA-YRL._SX300_.jpg

Thankfully Akron has made the ARKON Universal Smartphone Holder and Flexible Mini Tripod as a way to keep your mobile device stabilized in several positions.&#9654; Package Contents&#8226; Flexible Mini Tripod&#8226; Mobile Grip 2 Universal Smartphone holder&#8226; Tripod to Ball adapter&#8226; Carrying pouch&#9654; AccessoriesFor this mount, the accessories include a Mobile Grip 2 Universal Smartphone holder, a tripod to ball adapter, and a carrying pouch. The carrying pouch successfully carries, the holder, attachment, and tripod effectively. The Smartphone holder is a hard plastic black, with two spring loaded legs, and is the same one used withArkon Windshield or Dashboard Sticky Suction Car Mount, which means it is interchangeable with this windshield mount. The front has the Arkon logo and two 0.75 x 0.75 rubber legs. The bottom has a removable bolt to mount onto the flexible tripod. The back has a threaded ring when needing to mount this to a compatible extension. The description pictures show this mount attached to a ball that is attached to the threaded ring, which is misleading. The tripod to ball adapter allows the user to view in a 360 angle, giving the user optiminal mobility. This adapter may or may not be included with your package, because it was only included recently, which if it isn&#8217;t, you can email warranty@arkon.com to get the part sent at no charge.&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Product Dimensions: 10.5 x 6 x 2 inches; 5.6 ounces&#8226; Mobile Grip 2 Holder fits all Smartphone up to 3.6 inches wide&#8226; Tripod is able to hold standard -inch 20 threaded camera pattern&#9654; HardwareUnlike the product dimension specs state, this mount is 10.5 inches tall with the holder, not 12 inches. Without the holder, this stand can reach up to 7.5 inches tall. Even if this stand isn&#8217;t able to reach very high, it has a very unique 3 gooseneck leg design, which are each able to move out about 3 inches each, giving the user the ability to wrap the mount around other objects around 4-5 inches in diameter. You could imagine this mount being on a rail, pole, or even unconventional mounting areas, such as branches on trees. At the center of the tripod is the tightening screw for adjusting the tripod top, which is able to mount the included Smartphone holder directly, the tripod to ball adapter (to attach the smart phone holder), or any digital camera. This tripod mount with cell phone holder is able to move your cell phone in 360 angle, but has only one set position, while the Tripod to ball adapter gives it a 360 angle at several positions.&#9654; SetupSetup for the mount should be very straight forward. As said in hardware, you can mount the universal holder with or without the attachment.Attaching Digital Cameras:1. Attach camera by screwing it onto the 1/4&#8221; &#8211; 20 thread mounting bolt2. Loosen the adjustment knob to change position and retighten to set.3. Release the &#8221; &#8211; 20 thread mount by unscrewing lateral screw and pressing on release tab.Using the Mobile Grip 2 Universal Holder directly:Pre-requisite &#8211; Remove the bolt on the bottom of the holder1. Screw end of Mobile Grip 2 Universal onto the &#8221; &#8211; 20 thread mounting bolt2. Insert device and adjust as needed.It took me approximately 20 minutes to understand how to attach the holder directly to the mounting bolt. Hopefully you don&#8217;t have these issues if you choose this position.Using the tripod to ball attachment:1. Screw attachment onto &#8221; &#8211; 20 thread mounting bolt2. Place adjustment ring over the pedestal ball and snap Mobile Grip 2 Universal Holder onto pedestal.3. Insert device and tighten ring to set position.&#9654; TestingI tested this with my Zune HD, iPod 4th and 5th gen, iPhone 5, and Nexus 7 2013 (using a different holder and adapter). Each of the smaller devices fit very well inside the holder, while the Nexus 7 2013 was too heavy because too much weight was applied to the head of the tripod. I was able to successfully place the stand, with and without attachment, around my living room lamp, my OxyLED Desk Lamp, on my porch rail, and the rail on my fan without each device falling. The ball attachment definitely gets better mobility and view of my mobile device than without it. The construction of the gooseneck legs are very good, because all of these devices were able to fit for extended periods of time without falling. I was overall pleased by the functions of this device.&#9654; Final ThoughtsAs long as the weight of your phone isn&#8217;t too heavy, you should have absolutely no problems with this tripod stand. I would recommend this product anyone needing a budget friendly tripod, and give this a 5 star rating.Pros:+ A well constructed, budget friendly, gooseneck legged, Universal tripod mount, which gets the job done for small and light devices.+ Tripod attachment gives your mobile device the full 360 angle, instead of one set viewing angle with the tripod to holder directly.+ Compatible with digital cameras and mobile devices.+ Gooseneck legs are able to fit around different shaped objects without falling.Cons:- Installing the holder onto the tripod (directly) isn&#8217;t intuitive, while holder to adapter to tripod is intuitive.- Tripod head isn&#8217;t able to support the weight of tablets.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XpeQCcg9L._SY300_.jpg

On the back of the holder is an adjustment ring and ball, which gives the user a complete 360 degree view, to a 4 inch arm which is held by an adjustment knob, and then to the 3 inch wide suction cup, which is held by the suction lock lever. This is a very nice suction cup, compared to ones sold in stores, as the suction cup lock allows this mount a half inch of pressure when applying it to the desired surface.&#9654; SetupSetup for this device is fairly straight forward.1. Attach pedestal to dash or window, engage suction lock.2. Place adjustment ring over the pedestal ball and snap Mobile Grip 2 Universal Holder onto pedestal.3. Insert device and tighten ring to set position.&#9654; TestingI tested this with my iPhone 5 in my friend's company F350 for 24 hours, 4 hours being through mud and gravel. The fit for my mobile phone was very nice and stable, which is unusual because it feels more secure than the upgraded version. The suction cup stayed on the windshield despite being on the rough and rocky road. The ability of this suction cup impresses me, as any other similar mount would have at least fallen once or twice during my test. I would definitely purchase this mount for a friend.&#9654; Final ThoughtsI really like this mount, as it stood the heavy duty conditions, and maintained stability conditions, but isn't compatible with Arkon's other mounting solutions, as this was probably done as a cost effective measure. In any case, I still recommend this device to anyone needing a mobile device mount, and is why I give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ A very powerful phone car mount, allowing the user definite suction (no drops during tests).+ A superior holder to Arkon's SM679 Slim-Grip Ultra Multi Surface Sticky Suction Mount.+ Arm and ball design allow the user to move their device in a 360 degree motion, and various amounts of angles.+ Very simple and efficient setup.Cons:- Isn't compatible with Arkon's other interchangeable bracket and mounts as a cost effective measure.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41inrlNj-tL._SX300_.jpg

Because it is common, it is also easily accessible if ever damaged, lost, or stolen, and also easily purchased at many department stores. You may have two or three of these cables already and not realize it.&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Bluetooth Standard:  Bluetooth V4.0&#8226; Frequency Range:  2.400 - 2.481GHz&#8226; Operation: Class 2&#8226; Bluetooth Mode: Headset/handfree/A2DP/AVRCP&#8226; Operation Range:  Up to 30 feet&#8226; Talk Time / Playing Time: Up to 15 hours, much longer than other Bluetooth headset&#8226; Standby Time: Up to 300 hours&#8226; Charging Time: 3 hours&#8226; Battery: 300 mAh Li-on battery&#8226; Dimension:  6.61 x 6.30 x 2.20 inch&#8226; Weight: 0.25 pounds&#9654; HardwareThese headphones are very small, both in size and weight (6.6&#8221; x 6.3&#8221; x 2.2&#8221; inches; 0.25 pounds). There is definitely no way that I would be able to fit these in my pocket, but the fact that they are foldable is a very nice touch. This product comes in a matt black plastic on the headband and sides, and black foam, which is typical for headphones in the $20 range. On the right side is the circular multifunction button, a multicolored LED light, and two other buttons for changing track and volume. On the bottom of the right side, is the micro USB port and microphone. On the opposite side is the Mpow logo and the same circular pattern which resembles the button the opposite side. The earpads, as said earlier, are black foam, square, and able to be rotated 90 to the left or right side  Each side of the headphones are capable of lowering 1.25&#8221; to form around your head. I&#8217;ve used several Bluetooth headphones, and most of them physically feel cheap, but these are probably best built in the sub $50.This is a set of headphones that are Bluetooth 4.0, with No auxiliary connection. They are capable of answering calls or listening to music, from a mobile device, tablet, or computer, without worrying about distortion or battery life, because of the Bluetooth 4.0 protocol.&#9654; Setup&#8226; Pairing:1. Press the multifunction button for about 8 seconds until the red and green lights start flashing alternately.2. Turn on the Bluetooth function of your phone.3. Search for the Bluetooth devices and select &#8220;MPOW&#8221;4. Enter the code &#8220;0000&#8221; if needed.5. If pairing is successful, green light indicator starts flashing&#8226; Charging1. Connect the USB charging cable to the USB charge port of the headset.2. The light indicator will turn into red when charging.3. The full charge takes about 3 hours.4. The red light indicator goes out and light indicator turns into green when charging completed.&#9654; TestingI tested this product for approximately 5-6 hours with different genres of music, including: Country, Rock, Punk, Metal, and Rap. The feedback from the three buttons was perfect. No sticking or any hindrance from the build. When worn, the headphones weren&#8217;t uncomfortable, except when removing them; Hair might get caught and pull, resulting in a frustrations. I also wish there was better padding.The music was clear, without distortions, and bass was OK for mid, but flat for low and high. As long as you haven&#8217;t worn headphones in the $200-$300 range, you shouldn&#8217;t notice any issues. The volume was never an issue, as there are 14 volume settings, which is very nice for them soft sounds. I was able to see a lifetime of 24 hours before the product stopped working. Imagine how much longer the product would run with a larger battery. Overall, the product impressed me.&#9654; Final ThoughtsConsidering the cost of the product, at under $36, you really can&#8217;t expect to receive the Taj Mahal of Bluetooth headphones. However, for what the headphones are, they are definitely well constructed. Mpow definitely is making well crafted, bargain products. I would be very interested to see what Mpow could do with a larger budget. In any case, I recommend this product to anyone that is searching for budget friendly Bluetooth headphones and give this product a 5 star rating. This would be ideal for someone who doesn&#8217;t want to spend hundreds of dollars for headphones, but doesn&#8217;t want to skimp on quality either.Pros:+ Well constructed build. Great feel and feedback from buttons and headband.+ Tested to last for about 24 hours before battery was depleted. Sound was clear, and bass was OK in mid range, but flat in low and high range. If you haven&#8217;t worn expensive headphones, then you shouldn&#8217;t have to worry about quality. Connection was never unintentionally disconnected.+ Several media buttons for answering calls or listening to music.+ Uses the very common micro USB interface.Cons:- When removed, the headphones pulled hair.- Earpads could be made more comfortable.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ufdx4K3IL._SY300_.jpg

I really like that this device uses the micro USB interface, because it is easily bought at any store with an electronics section, but wish this cable were longer. In the end, the convenience of not using proprietary equipment will save you money in the long run.&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Battery Type: Li-ion18650 LG Cell&#8226; Capacity: 3200mAh&#8226; Input: Micro USB 5V/1.0A&#8226; Output: 5V/1.0A&#8226; Dimension: 88.0*22.5*22.5mm&#8226; Weight: 67.0  10g&#9654; HardwareThe device is very small and light (3.4&#8221; x 0.9&#8221; x 0.9&#8221;; 2.4 ounces), and this is its selling point, its size. The device is comparable to the size of a lighter, in terms of height. You could easily put this in your pocket, bag, or purse, without using much space. The device has a very simplistic design, at the top is the micro USB connector for charging, USB port for charging your USB device, and a blue LED light, the right side has the AmzDeal logo, and the bottom has the specifications. Although I like that the design is very simplistic, I don&#8217;t like that there aren&#8217;t any buttons for activating the device, but that is a personal preference. As soon as a USB is connected, it is charging, which may be your choice.The battery composes of a 3200mAh battery, which should be enough to fully charge your mobile phone, or give your tablet a significant charge. Though, this battery is built small for small devices. If you are seeking a battery for a tablet then I&#8217;d suggest looking for one with an output of 2.0A instead of the 1.0A port that this one uses.LED Notification:&#8226; Blinking LED: Charging&#8226; Solid LED: Fully chargedLike the device, the LED notification is very simple, but there is no way to interpret the charge of the device. You won&#8217;t ever know the charge of the battery its dead. This may be frustrating, as you may assume your battery is charged, but it isn&#8217;t. Overall, I like the design, and simplicity.&#9654; SetupSetup is very straight forward.1. Take micro USB cable, place micro USB into battery.2. Take USB, and place that into a USB charger or computer.3. Wait until LED becomes solid.&#9654; TestingI tested this with my Samsung Galaxy Rush, using Android 4.1.2 with a 1750mAh battery, running no processes except system apps. I performed two tests, a multimeter test at the start and end, and a fast charge test to calculate the amount this device charges per an hour.Multimeter Test:The multimeter test attempts to test the voltage and current the device uses at the beginning and end of the test. Sometimes, devices remain the same current throughout the test, and sometimes the current lowers toward the end. It is nice to know if the power source is giving out less power by the end of the test. The current is the ampere the device is taking in, with max current the maximum amount of ampere the device is capable of taking in. The voltage is the amount the power source is capable of giving, with min voltage the lowest possible amount of the power source giving.&#8226; 8%Current: 0.31AVoltage: 4.87VMax Current: 0.33AMax Voltage: 4.82V&#8226; 95%Current: 0.10AVoltage: 4.65VMax Current: 0.12AMax Voltage: 4.59VThis test concludes that the external battery does slow its charge toward the end.Fast Charge Test:The fast charge test attempts to find the efficiency and performance of the power source. With external batteries, we can even find how efficient it is by using the battery until it goes out. For this test, I attempted to charge the mobile device twice, to get an accurate reading on the battery, however, we have to assume there will be some charge lost in the time in between tests. We should also take into consideration the loss of charge from charging one battery to another, due to the nature of how it is done; 60%-65% of the battery&#8217;s rated charge is acceptable.Theoretical times to Samsung Galaxy Rush: 3200mAh/1750mAh = 1.82 Times (If battery were 100% Efficient)Power Bank Size * Expected Efficiency (65%) = Expected Charge / Samsung Galaxy Rush Battery size = Expected Nexus 7 Charge3200mAh * 0.65 = 2080mAh/1750mAh = 118% Expected ChargeTime &#8211; Galaxy Rush charge %Start 15:12PM 8%5:37PM 30%6:16PM 65%6:41PM 86%7:19PM 100%Start 212:00AM 8%12:45AM 29%Samsung Galaxy Rush Battery Size x Amount Charged = Total Charge1750mA * (1.13) = 1977mATotal Charge / Battery rated size = Efficiency %1977mA / 3200mA = 61.78%Total Charge / Time (hours) = Charge per Hour1977mA/2.86h = 691.25mA per HourThis device charges at 691.25mA per an hour, with a 61.78% efficiency rating. Taking into consideration the loss of charge in the 5 hours that the device wasn&#8217;t being used, these are pretty good results. This device gets the job done and I am satisfied by these results.&#9654; Final ThoughtsIt&#8217;s a simple charger that gets the job done. It isn&#8217;t the fastest, but it isn&#8217;t the slowest either. Do I think this device can be improved? Definitely, but that is my own opinion. This would be the ideal present to people who aren&#8217;t tech savvy, or need a budget friendly stocking stuffer. I would personally recommend this device to anyone needing an external charger for their mobile phone and give this product 5 stars.Pros:+ It&#8217;s a simple design and has simple functionality. It is made for those who ask for nothing more.+ Tested to be within the acceptable efficiency and charge per an hour (61.78%; 691.25mAh)Cons:- No buttons for activating or deactivating device.- No charge % indicator. You could be carrying an almost full or almost empty battery and wouldn&#8217;t know until either you attempt charging the battery or it stops charging your USB device.- Micro USB is too short for my liking.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31nELbEnwoL._SY300_.jpg

Every year manufacturers create more advanced hardware and software while failing to create a more advanced battery; which leads to frustration because of the inefficient battery. Fortunately, Eachine has made the Eachine 3000mAh portable backup External battery Perfume power bank Charger as an external battery and flashlight for your USB charged devices.Inside the packaging is the flash light power bank, a 2-in-1 USB charger, a silk bag, and a user manual. I really like the simplistic design of the power bank, and the fact that it comes with a flash light. A lot of power banks this size don&#8217;t include a flashlight, so this is a great feature.This power bank includes a apple 30 pin connector (4th gen iPod and previous models) and a micro USB connector. The length of the cord is about 8-8.5 inches with a white design that is similar to all apple cords. The gauge of the wire is also comparable to iPod cords.The included bag is made of a silk material and measures 5 x 2 inches. It can fit the power bank inside it very nicely but has issues when the power bank and charger cord is included. Most power banks don&#8217;t include a bag, so this is a very nice feature to have included with the device.The power bank is fairly small and light (0.8 x 0.8 x 4.2 inches and 3 ounces). For the price of $14.99, this is the perfect present to anyone who needs the flashlight and power bank combo, and it also comes in four really stylish colors: red, black, silver, and gold. At the top face is the Eachine logo, a button which activates the flashlight, and an LED indicator (statuses below):When charging:Red LED = Device is chargingBlue LED = Device is fully chargedWhen On:Blue LED = Indicates device is on.I wish this device would include indicators other than the two LEDs. Many other devices would include at least four LEDs to indicate how charged this device is. At the bottom is a micro USB port to charge the device and a 5V 1A port to charge your USB device. I like that this is charged by micro USB, as this is a very common cord that can be bought at most convenient stores if it were ever lost, damaged, or stolen. At the top is the flash light that is activated from the button on the top face.I started by testing the time to charge the power banks (red, black, gold, silver). They all initially had the red LED and was able to successfully charge within 2.5 hours. These results are pretty good for a battery this size. I then tested the flashlight, and found that the light is very bright. I would definitely use this battery for the flash light alone. The button to activate the flashlight is very responsive, as I am able to turn the light and off immediately.I then tested this with my Nexus 7 (2013), running Android 4.2.2, with a 3950 mAh battery, and my iPod 4th generation, running iOS 6.1.6, with a 930 mAh battery. The connector for both the micro USB and apple 30 pin connector both aren&#8217;t great fits. The connectors both have trouble fitting in their counter parts, which is unfortunate since this cord would save a lot of space. I started by testing my Nexus 7 (2013) and found that my device is taking the following from the power bank:0.36A5.26V0.5 Peak A5.21 Min VThese are good results, as my Nexus 7 doesn&#8217;t take the entire 1A from the external battery. I then tested how long and efficient the battery was:Test 1:20% 6:45pm55% 7:44pm62% 7:56pm &#8211; Red power bank overheatedTest 2:1% 12:23am19% 1:22am20% 1:23am &#8211; Black power bank overheatedI was able to successfully charge my Nexus 7 (2013) 42% in 1 hour 11 minutes and 19% in 1 hour, but unfortunately the batteries over heated. This is disappointing that such a stylish looking power bank would experience such issues.I then tested this on the iPod 4th generation:0% 8:13pm - Gray100% 10:30pm - Blue light still and still charging930 mA h / 2.25 hours = 413 mA per hourI was able to charge the device from 0% to 100% in 2 hours 17 minutes. This is 413 mA an hour, which isn&#8217;t horrible for any device, but isn&#8217;t great either. I do want to note that this external battery does not have any automatic shut off when your device is fully charged, so please keep an eye on the charger while your device is being charged.I reviewed this product prior to the warnings that tablets weren&#8217;t recommended to be charged. As long as you heed these warnings, this is a quality battery that is definitely worth every penny, and is why I give this product 5 out of 5 stars.Pros:+ Price at 14.99 is the perfect price point to anyone who needs flash light and power bank combo.+ Portable and perfect for travel.+ Uses micro USB interface for charging, which is a very common cord that can be bought at any convenient store if it were lost, damaged, or stolen.+ Very simplistic and stylish design.+ Choice of four colors (Black, red, gold, silver)+ Includes micro USB and apple 30 pin connector in one cord.+ Includes a very bright LED flashlight for the dark.+ Includes a silk bag that is able to fit the power bank inside, but not able to fit connector and power bank.Cons:- Not able to charge tablets.- Has no automatic shut off when your device is fully charged.- Includes a silk bag that is able to fit the power bank inside, but not able to fit connector and power bank.- Only two LED indicators: Red for charging, blue for fully charged and on. Most other power banks would include at least 4 LEDs to indicate charge.- Fit of the micro USB and apple 30 pin connector isn&#8217;t great. They both have trouble fitting the connectors.I was supplied this sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FylD8VfgL._SY300_.jpg

Sometimes we are a foot deep in mud and need our mobile device to change, but are unable to, due to manufacturers not creating such a device, until now. New Trent has made the New Trent PowerPak Ultra 14000mAh Portable Dual USB Port External Battery Charger/Power Pack as water proof, shock proof, and dirt proof power bank for those rough days.&#61592;Package Contents:&#8226; NT1 40R-B(lack) or NT1 40R-O(range) Powerpak Ultra Battery pack&#8226; Micro USB Cable&#8226; User Manual&#61592;Accessories:This power bank includes one micro USB cable, approximately 33 inches long. The cable is thick gauged with a thick plastic enclosure around the USB and micro USB connectors.

The several hard edges on the frame, 8 triangle screws, and water texture on the top and bottom face, give this an extremely rugged but sleek look. I can really imagine my friend, who puts power lines for a living, using such a device because he is constantly deep in mud for 8-10 hours a day, away from any working power outlet within close proximity. When you are working against the terrain, you need your mobile device, and can&#8217;t always keep it in your truck to suck the battery life out of your vehicle. This device can come in two colors: Black and orange, which is good if you prefer one color over the other. On the top face is the NewTrent name and logo, and a rubber button, when pressed for two seconds can enable or disable the external battery pack and the four blue LED lights, which are also on the front face as well. The four LED lights have the following statuses:LED Statuses:4 LED = 100% Charged3 LED = 75% Charged2 LED = 50% Charged1 LED = 25% Charged0 LED = Not chargedOn the top are two flaps that cover outlet 1, a 1A pot, and outlet 2, a 2.1A port. These flaps have some resistance when removing and applying, so make sure to not apply too much pressure to break off these flaps. On the left side is the micro USB port, for charging the device, which also has a flap over it for proofing the device. I understand the overall build, as every component of this power bank was solely intended for proofing the device from rugged environment. I can imagine dropping this on the ground, or running it over with my vehicle, and still avoid it from damaging.&#61592;Testing:I tested this power bank using my Nexus 7 (2013), running stock Android 4.4.2, with a 3950mAh battery, during idle mode. I would start by running this device through the mud and puddles, without completely submerging it into the water, and then charge my Nexus device. I benchmarked the current and voltage that my Nexus was taking using my Centech USB Power Meter, and found the following results:2.1A Port:Current: 0.46AVoltage: 4.92VPeak Current: 0.50AMin Required Voltage: 4.83V1A Port:Current: 0.47AVoltage: 4.93VPeak Current: 0.50AMin Required Voltage: 4.83PVMy Nexus is taking a much higher amount of current than usually (About 1.25-1.5x more than usual), which is great if I intend to charge my device as a fast rate. I then tested the battery speed and efficiency:9:33AM: 20%11:41AM: 92%12:04PM 99%12:09PM 100% - Still charging3950mAh * 0.80 = 3160mAh Total Charged3160mAh / 2.5 hours = 1264mA per Hour3 LED = About 75% = 14000mAh * 0.25 = 3500mAh3160mAh/3500mAh = 90% EfficientThe power bank charged a total of 3160mAh in 2.5 hours, or 1264mA per an hour. These are about 1.5-2x the normal charge rate that my tablet would normally charge. These, along with the 90% Efficiency rate, when having a 70% Efficient battery is expected, make this one of the best options for both inside and outside external batteries. I am extremely satisfied with this device.&#61592;Final Thoughts:I really like the design and performance of this device, and recommend it as the best option to anyone whom is in the market for a large, rugged, external battery, and is why I give this product 5 out of 5 stars. If I could, I would rate this 7 or 8 stars out of 5, as this is the best tested battery I have tested.Packaging: 5/5Charging cord: 5/5Construction of power bank: 5/5Durability: 5/5Aesthetically pleasing: 5/5Benchmark Test: 5/5Charging Test: 5/5Efficiency Test: 5/5Pros:+ Fast and Efficient power bank (3160mAh in 2.5 hours, 90% Efficient)+ Durable, and can stand the tough terrain, being Water, dirt, and shock proof.+ Requires micro USB to charge, which isn&#8217;t proprietary.+ Blue LED indicates charge.Cons:- No cons for this device.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41rW-lVdSjL._SX300_.jpg

Fortunately, SHARKK has made the SHARKK 25W 5-Port USB Wall Plug Family-Sized Desktop Charger Power Adapter as a USB charger that doesn&#8217;t require your computer.&#9654; Package Contents1 x SHARKK 25W 5-Port USB Power Adapter1 x Power cord&#9654; AccessoriesThe only accessory that is included this device is a 55 inch white 2-prong power adapter. This adapter is very similar to the construction of laptop power adapters, which is good, since this adapter can be easily replaced if it ever were to be damaged. The fact that the adapter is a little over 4 feet makes this the perfect adapter in work stations. I overall like the power adapter concept, and that SHARKK chose to not include any proprietary charging.&#9654; SpecificationsInput: AC 100V-240VOutput:&#8226; USB x 5 - 5V/5A (Max)&#8226; USB 1 - 2.1A (iPad)&#8226; USB 2 - 1.3A (Samsung Tab)&#8226; USB 3 &#8211; 2.1A (iPad)&#8226; USB 4 &#8211; 1A (iPhone)&#8226; USB 5 &#8211; 1A (Android)Dimension: 98mm * 60mm * 26mmWeight: 153.5g  5g&#9654; HardwareThe product images make this product much bulkier than it really is (3.8 x 2.3 x 1 inches; 5.4 ounces). It is a very small and light device that you can hold in your hand like a mobile phone. This product only comes in a glossy white plastic, but looks very sleek and minimalistic without being a fingerprint magnet. On the front are 5 ports with the text &#8220;iPad, Samsung Tab, iPad, iPhone, and Android&#8221; over one of each of the ports. I really like the concept, but wish these ports also had the 1A, 1.3A, or 2.1A text as well, as I automatically assumed &#8220;Android&#8221; was a 2.1A port, but wasn&#8217;t. For the average person buying this product this won&#8217;t matter, but I would prefer the most current for my tablets, which are rated at 2.1A. On the left side is the SHARKK name and logo, and on the back is the power adapter port and specifications. I overall like the build of this product, as it doesn&#8217;t look a simple USB charger with a plastic enclosure, and with the price tag being less than $20.00 ($17.00) makes this one of the cheapest USB chargers and the perfect stocking stuffer.&#9654; SetupSetup doesn&#8217;t get simpler than with this device. Plug the two prong power adapter into the USB charger, and then into your wall outlet.&#9654; TestingI tested this device with my Nexus 7 (2013), running stock Android 4.4.2, with a 3950mAh battery, using no processes other than system apps. I first started to test the current and voltage that my Nexus was taking from the Android port at 1% and 80% and found the following results:1%:Current: 1.11AVoltage: 4.86VPeak Current: 1.14AMinimum Required Voltage: 4.75V80%Current: 0.22AVoltage: 4.93VPeak Current: 0.24AMinimum Required Voltage: 4.83VThese results are very appealing since the port can give more current than the port is rated at.

I am definitely satisfied with these results.&#9654; Final ThoughtsOverall, the build quality is nice, the results tested well, and this is overall a well made product. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a USB charger, and is why I give this product 5 out of 5 stars. You would think for the cheaper price that you would get a cheaper product, but SHARKK has made a well crafted product that undercuts its competitors.Pros:+ A five port USB charger, in the sub $20 range, using materials that don&#8217;t feel cheap; the perfect stocking stuffer.+ Performed well using the 1A charger during tests.+ Very common power adapter provided; very easy to replace if adapter is ever damaged.Cons:- Text over ports needs to also state the current for each port: 1A, 1.3A, or 2.1AI was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41OpOGAA0YL._SY300_.jpg

You have to pick up your phone to check the LED indicator, and then hold the phone. Fortunately, you can use the RAVPower RP-UC06 Universal Micro-USB Desktop Charging Cradle instead, allowing you to charge and check your phone without lifting a finger.&#9654; Package Contents&#8226; RAVPower RP-UC06&#8226; Micro USB Cable&#8226; Power Adapter&#9654; AccessoriesThis device includes a 40&#8221; micro USB cable, and a 2.5&#8221; x 0.875&#8221; x 1.5&#8221; power adapter. I really like that this device uses the micro USB interface, because it is easily bought at any store with an electronics section, but wish this cable were longer. In the end, the convenience of not using proprietary equipment will save you money in the long run. The power adapter is rated at 1A an should eff&#9654; HardwareThe device is very small 2.75&#8221; x 1.5&#8221; x 2.75&#8221;, and is designed to dock any micro USB phone. In its simplest form, this is just a fancy micro USB cable. The back has the micro USB port to connect into, and the front has the RAVPower name and the micro USB port that can adjust about 20  forward and backward. If your phone is thicker than 0.5&#8221; then don&#8217;t bother buying this product. When your phone is properly in the slot, it should tilt about 50 to 60, giving you the optiminal viewing space for doing certain tasks while looking very stylish.I will note ahead of time that this micro USB connector only goes one way. I wouldn&#8217;t use this for your tablet, unless you are very experienced in soldering wire. The electrical board supports the connector to be the opposite side, but that requires the following instructions.1. Pop out the plastic surrounding the micro USB cable2. Unscrew the PCB from the device3. Lightly pulling on the PCB and desoldering the wires4. Move the PCB to the correct position and soldier the wires again.WARNING: There are springs when removing this out! Also, this will VOID your warranty.I can&#8217;t provide pictures, as I don&#8217;t have the proper equipment anymore. I would also recommend to connect additional wire, as it is very short.&#9654; TestingI tested this product with my Samsung Galaxy Rush, a phone with a 1750mAh battery, running Android 4.1.2. . I performed two tests, a multimeter test at the start and end, and a fast charge test to calculate the amount this device charges per an hour.Multimeter Test:The multimeter test attempts to test the voltage and current the device uses at the beginning and end of the test. Sometimes, devices remain the same current throughout the test, and sometimes the current lowers toward the end. It is nice to know if the power source is giving out less power by the end of the test. The current is the ampere the device is taking in, with max current the maximum amount of ampere the device is capable of taking in. The voltage is the amount the power source is capable of giving, with min voltage the lowest possible amount of the power source giving.&#8226; 9%Current: 0.97AVoltage: 4.98VMax Current: 0.99AMin Voltage: 4.90V&#8226; 95%Current: 0.55AVoltage: 5.02VMax Current: 0.57AMin Voltage: 4.90VFrom this test, we can conclude that the device and power adapter will show close to the 1A of power in the beginning, but toward the end the charger will slow down.Fast Charge Test:The fast charge test attempts to find the efficiency and performance of the power source.Time &#8211; Galaxy Rush charge %3:53PM - 9%4:02PM - 15%4:12PM - 24%4:22PM - 33%4:32PM - 43%4:42PM - 51%4:52PM - 61%5:01PM - 70%5:12PM - 79%5:22PM - 86%5:32PM - 92%5:42PM - 95%5:52PM - 98%6:02PM - 100%Galaxy Rush Battery Size x Amount Charged = Total Charge1750mA * (0.91) =1592.5mATotal Charge / Time (hours) = Charge per Hour1592.5mA/2h =796.25mA per HourThis device charges at 796mA per an hour, which considering my OEM wall charger only charges at approximately 600mA per an hour, this is an amazingly fast result for a USB charger. These results conclude the power source charges fast.&#9654; Final ThoughtsThe overall fit and rate of charge for this device is very fast. You could be paying $20-$25 for a charger made by the manufacturer, or pay under $20 for a charging cradle. I would definitely recommend this device to anyone needing a phone charging cradle, and give this product a 5 star rating. This is absolutely a good stocking stuffer.Pros:+ Cheaper than OEM chargers and charges faster than my OEM charger (796mA per hour)+ Charges and docks your phone in a very stylish manner.Cons:- Phones thicker than 0.5&#8221; inches can&#8217;t fit.- Although it is possible to connect this to your tablet, if you want it to look correct, it requires experience in soldiering.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mw5FAsImL._SX300_.jpg

Both of these are major problems, because USB 2.0 and 3.0 only produce 500mA and 900mA of power, respectfully, which would cause much longer charge times, and having multiple AC adapters blocks surge protector outlets. RAVPower introduced the &#8220;Bolt&#8221; to ease these issues.I received this item, and upon unboxing I found the RAVPower Bolt 30W/6A, an AC Power cord, and the instruction manual. I have come to realize that RAVPower makes very compact electronics, and this one follows suit. The Bolt is so small that it fits in the palm of my plan, which is great for any person who travels and needs time to power their device.This device includes a two prong, black, detachable, power cord which is around 2-3 feet. The cord itself has a thin gauged wire for such an electronic drawing 30W/6A, but I understand that this was made to cut costs. Having a universal two prong cord is a plus, because it can easily be replaced, and doesn&#8217;t block neighboring wall sockets. This also prevents the whole device falling from a wall outlet in the case that someone accidentally brushes against it.The Bolt (3.6 x 3.5 x 1.5 inches) is very small for an AC adapter. It has a black, matt, hard plastic finish, rounded corners, four USB Ports (from left to right: 2.1A, 2.1A, 1A, and 1A), four rubberized feet, and a blue LED light to indicate the charger is being used. By having a maximum of 6A, it is possible to charge all four USB devices without issues.I have personally tested this product with the following:+ RAVPower Qi Charger &#8220;Orbit&#8221; (http://www.amazon.com/RAVPower%C2%AE-Qi-Enabled-Wireless-Incredible-Single-Position/dp/B00GN5U5N8)+ RAVPower Deluxe External Battery (http://www.amazon.com/RAVPower-Lightning-Thunderbolt-Incredible-connectors/dp/B00EHEEFWY)+ Nexus 7 [2013] (http://www.amazon.com/Google-Nexus-Tablet-7-Inch-Black/dp/B00DVFLJKQ/)+ Nyko Playpad Pro (http://www.amazon.com/Playpad-Android-Bluetooth-PC-Mac-Linux/dp/B0092ZEINO)+ Amazon Kindle Fire (http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Fire-HD-Display-Wi-Fi/dp/B00C5W16B8/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1391556555)+ Zune HD 32GB (http://www.amazon.com/Zune-Video-Media-Player-Black/dp/B005G01THW/ref=sr_1_15?srs=2530847011&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1391556658)Each and every electronic didn&#8217;t seem to lose any power by filling all the USB ports. They took an equal amount of time compared to each respective AC adapter. This is a huge plus because it de-clutters my desktop and wall outlets at the same time.Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to make space of their USB ports and wall socket outlets. The price is only $19.99, which is a great price for what this charger does. This device does exactly what it claims to do, charge, and it does it well.Pros:+ Price @ $19.99 is great for 4 USB outlets at 30W/6A.+ Unique design, device doesn&#8217;t directly plug into wall socket.+ Portable and light weighted.+ De-clutters wall sockets, surge protectors, and computer USB outlets.+ Power cord easily replaceable if damaged, lost, or stolen.+ Charges all devices without issues.Cons:- Gauge of power cord is very thin.I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest and thorough review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41c58uMDn3L._SX300_.jpg

On the side is the iClever name and logo, and on the end are two USB ports, one marked Android (DC5V/1A) and Apple (DC5V/2.6A). I wish the ports would be marked with its current setting instead of &#8220;Apple&#8221; and &#8220;Android&#8221; because some Android devices require more than 1A to charge. I really like the overall design of this product, but unfortunately it has a very similar design to RAVPower&#8217;s car charger. The only difference from the two products is the Apple port current (2.6A) of iClever&#8217;s product is higher than RAVPower&#8217;s (2.1A).&#9654; TestingI tested this product with my Honda Odyssey and my Nexus 7 (2013) with a 3950mA battery, running no processes except system apps.

I like that PowerBot chose to use the micro USB interface,  as it is a very common interface used by Android devices today. Not having a proprietary interface means people can easily replace their cables at their local department store. Having two cables makes it very convenient for charging your device wirelessly or wired, and not having to deal with wire management. One thing that should have been included is an AC charger.

On the back are four rubber feed and specifications.&#8226; LED Indicator:4 LED = 100% Capacity3 LED = 75%2 LED = 50%1 LED &#8804; 25%&#9654; Set up&#8226; Charging External Battery1. Connect the device to a power adapter (or USB port from a computer, although it will only charge a fraction of the rate).2. Connect adapter to the USB changing port, the other micro USB to the power bank.&#8226; Using Qi Charger1. Connect the device to a power adapter (or USB port from a computer, although it will only charge a fraction of the rate).2. Place your Qi compatible device on the rubber ring, you should hear a beep and the blue LED light illuminated.&#9654; TestingI tested both, the external battery and Qi charger with my Nexus 7 (2013), using Android L, with a 3950mAh battery. I am running absolutely no processes except system apps. For the battery, I calculated the efficiency and charge rate, and just the charge rate for Qi charger. With these results, we can calculate whether this charger and battery is worth purchasing or not.&#8226; Battery:Batteries follow a charge standard. When a battery discharges, it loses about 60% of its capacity. As long as this battery is 60% efficient, it passes my quality test.Time &#8211; Nexus 7 Charge %&#8211; LEDs on Battery10:48PM &#8211; 7% &#8211; 4 LED11:29PM &#8211; 20%1:28AM &#8211; 58%2:42AM &#8211; 81%3:48AM &#8211; 100% &#8211; 2 LED left6:02AM &#8211; 20%7:28AM &#8211; 36% &#8211; 0 LED leftTotal Charge: 113% (4463.5mA)Total Time: 6.43hCharge Rate = Total Charge/Total Time = 4463.5mAh/6.43h = 694mA per hourEfficiency = Total Charge/Battery Capacity = 4463.5mAh/6000mAh = 74.39%The battery charges around average, at 694mA per hour, and is 74.39% efficient, which is very efficient. I am satisfied by these results.&#8226; Qi Charger:I then tested the same for the Qi charger. Because the Qi charger has no capacity, I cannot determine efficiency. I can determine charge rate though.Time &#8211; Nexus 7 Charge %7:05PM &#8211; 3%7:26PM &#8211; 11%8:10PM &#8211; 31%8:45PM &#8211; 50%9:56PM &#8211; 90%10:40PM &#8211; 100%Total Charge: 97% (3831.5.5mA)Total Time: 3.58hCharge Rate = Total Charge/Total Time = 3831.5mAh/3.58h = 1070mA per hourThe charge rate is very fast for a wireless charger, charging at 1070mA per hour. These are indeed very good results.&#9654; Final ThoughtsIts weird that the Qi charger charges almost 2 times faster than the external battery, but the battery is very efficient. I would definitely recommend these products to any individual and give this a 5 star rating. For the price of under $29.00, the performance of this device makes this price a steal.Pros:+ Product feels well made, with the choice of wireless charging or external battery, for a fraction of the cost of its competitors.+ Qi charger tested to charge fast (1070mA), and battery tested to be very efficient (74%).+ Uses micro USB interface, which is easily obtained, and includes two in packaging.+ Has touch sensitive button.Cons:- Battery is somewhat bulky for its size.- 2A charger not included.- Charge rate of battery was average (694mA per hour)I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31WUe-Nn3XL._SX300_.jpg

The micro USB cable is black, almost flat, and well made, with clips at on the micro USB connector for keeping the connection sturdy. I like that this uses the micro USB interface, as it is the most common interface used by Android devices, and is easily replaceable. The earhooks are literally eartips of different size for the best fit. The carrying case is black, with a red MPow logo, and has red stitching at the top to seal the retractable straps. This was a very nice touch, as it keeps the device sealed when it isn&#8217;t opened.

This device has three buttons: a volume up/next track, volume down/previous track, and multifunctional button for pairing, pausing music, and answering a call. At the bottom is the micro USB port for charging the device and red/green LED. The LED is made solely as a charging indicator. When the battery is low, a voice will repeat, &#8220;Battery Low&#8221; every minute until the battery is charged or depleted. Overall the device is built very simple and built very well.This device is made with Bluetooth 4.0 in mind, which is the most recent Bluetooth software.

This far exceeds the expectations in the specifications, which is a very surprising result.  The sound quality was clear, without any distortions, but I can&#8217;t honestly rate base, as this only fits one ear. The buttons were very fluid and capable of performing tasks without sticking. The device fit well around my ear but it was difficult to properly fit the smallest silicon eartip into my ear. This was expected though, as I have very small ear canals. After the 14 hour period, the device didn&#8217;t make my ear sore, unlike similar products I have used before, which is very refreshing. The only test with unsatisfactory results was the range, as it tested to only have a 10-12 foot range, instead of the rated 33 feet. My cell phone has connected to other Bluetooth products with a range of over 50 feet, so I am unsure why this device would have these results. Overall, beside this one issue, I am very satisfied by the usage, functionality, and design of the product.&#9654; Final ThoughtsThe product fit well, is well crafted, and tested well. Overall, this product is the best headset I&#8217;ve reviewed (out of 3), which is why I absolutely recommend this product and give a 5 star rating.Pros:+ A very clear and comfortable headset, tested to exceed music play time (10 hours w/5 hours standby).+ Product, case, and silicon tips are well crafted, from the stitching on the case, to the fluid buttons.Cons:- Only tested to have a 10 foot Bluetooth range.- Device&#8217;s ear tips had issues fitting in my ear.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41iWb4SNNML._SY300_.jpg

Everything from MP3 Players and mobile phones to mug warmers and multimeters are all powered by USBs. RAVPower has made the RAVPower Dual Port 15.5W 3.1A USB Car Charger for users that want to charge their devices from their vehicle.When I first opened the packaging, I realized how small the device really is very small (3.9 x 2.6 x 1.4 inches) and light (1.6 ounces).  I figured that this device would be very large, like many other USB car chargers that I have bought, but it isn't. The device has the push in part at the end of the charger, with two push in balls and black metal to keep the car charger into the cigarette outlet, with a groove and red LED indicator in between the 2.1A and 1A USB ports. The RAVPower name on the side and the text to indicate which USB port is 2.1A and 1A.Specifications:&#8226; Output DC 5V 2A & 5V 1A&#8226; Input 12-24V 1000mA&#8226; Size 3.9 x 2.6 x 1.4 inches&#8226; Weight 1.6 ouncesWhen the car charger is plugged in, the LED indicator is on to indicate the USB ports are able to charge devices. The car charger sticks out about 1.5 inches and firmly fits in the cigarette lighter without any issues. I was able to successfully charge my Nexus 7 (2013), running Android 4.2.2, with a 3950mAh battery. The Nexus 7 was able to achieve the following results:0.21A5.14V0.24 Peak A4.98 Min VThe Nexus 7 was able to take 0.21A from the charger, allowing more than 2.9A to be used. Because devices don't use the full 2.1A, you are able to use both USB ports without compromising your device from charging slower.Because of the size and usability, this is a great USB car charger for a quick charge, and is why I recommend this to anyone who needs a cheap USB car charger without compromising quality. I give this product 5 out of 5 stars.Pros:+ Very cheap but that doesn't compromise quality. RAVPower makes good, durable, products.+ Devices don't take much current, which allows two tablets to simultaneously charge.+ Very small and light. Very compact for a car charger.+ Choice of two colors (White and black).Cons:- I have no cons for this device.I was supplied a sample in exchange for an honest and thorough review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31JZ6gGonoL._SX300_.jpg

Devices are evolving to the point that they are able to wirelessly charge. The CHOE UPGRADED Qi Wireless Charger Charging Pad is a great example for devices evolving. This small device can charge devices, such as tablets, that are much larger than the wireless charger itself.Inside the package is the Qi charging pad, a micro USB cable and an instruction packet. Te packaging is also very small, but able to safely fit its contents inside. My initial thought is that this is the smallest Qi charger that I have (3.6 x 0.4 x 3.6 inches).The charging pad has a mat black finish. The top has an imprint of the Choetech logo. The front has a blue LED that is on when a compatible Qi device is placed. The back has a micro USB slot to power the wireless charger, but does not include an actual AC adapter to power the device. Using the USB 2.0/3.0 ports on a desktop or laptop would only give 0.9A max, which isn&#8217;t efficient for charging a device. Using the included AC adapter of your device should be used.

The results were as follows:43% 5:12pm60% 6:28pm71% 7:12pmThe battery went from 43% to 71% in two hours, or 28%. This means it would take roughly 7-8 hours to fully charge this device. These results aren&#8217;t horrible but aren&#8217;t great either. For the portability, it does charge the device well.Overall, this device is made with portability in mind. I would recommend this device to individuals that need a portable device to wirelessly charge their device, and why I give it a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.Pros:+ Smallest Qi charge device that I own.

The plastic casing has the mywerkz logo, and connects to a very thick gauged wire (26 AWG versus 18 AWG of standard cable), probably the thickest 3.5mm stereo cable that I now own. In audio, if the wire is thicker, the bass is more prevalent, giving you the ultimate experience. iWerkz definitely did that for this product. My only problem with this product is the shortness of the cord, as it is only 3.3 feet, which iWerkz doesn&#8217;t produce.&#9654; TestingI tested this with my Brainwavz HM9 headphones, which already have really good bass. I tested this with several genres of music, including: rap, country, rock, alternative, classic rock, and popular.

I was overall very pleased with this cable, other than it being too short for my liking.&#9654; Final ThoughtsIf iWerkz made a larger cable, then I would probably use it over the standard Brainwavz cable. The sound quality and bass improved on headphones that already had amazing sound and bass, which is why I recommend this product to anyone needing a short audio cable, and is why I give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ Very thick gauge wire, capable of connecting to several media devices with an auxiliary input.+ During my tests, bass was much better than the included cable on my Brainwavz HM9&#8217;s.Cons:- For my personal liking, I like cables longer than 3.3 feet.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31nRXx21f7L._SY300_.jpg

Like other Tylt products, its sleek design blows similar products out of the water! Inside the package comes the Tylt Tunz, three silicone covers (Red, Black, Blue) , a black cloth bag, a micro USB cable, a male to male auxiliary cable, and the user guide.My first thoughts when I was looking at the packaging was how well made it was. It was covered by a thick plastic box, which could have been dropped from a two story building without scratching the speaker; I was definitely impressed.Auxiliary Cable:The auxiliary cable is 21 inches long. The design for this cable is unique because it isn&#8217;t a round cable, instead its flat. I tugged on the cord and it seems to be very durable.Covers:The Tunz comes with three covers: Red, Black, and Blue. The reason why it comes with three covers is because the speaker, itself, only comes in one color. This is unfortunate, but at least Tylt gives you the option to customize your Tunz with three choices.Micro USB Cable:This micro USB cable is easily the best one that I own. The construction of the connector is firmly attached to the cord, and isn&#8217;t connected by heat shrink wrap like my Nexus 7 cord was. This cord is very durable, and its quality shouldn&#8217;t go unnoticed.Black cloth bag:This also comes with a black cloth bag, which is a nice idea to prevent your speaker from being dusty. Unfortunately, with one of the silicone covers, it is very difficult to maneuver the speaker from entering the bag. I wish the bag would have been a bit bigger to accommodate the silicone cover.Tunz Speaker:The speaker is pretty compact for what it is, 2.6 x 5.3 x 3.4 inches. The size is perfect for carrying around, but is too big to fit in your pocket. The front of the speaker has this diamond in and diamond out design. The design is very appealing and looks very nice from afar. The top of the speaker has a microphone and four soft buttons: volume up, volume down, Bluetooth (multifunction), and phone button. The back has an AUX In port, AUX Out port, Output (Female USB), Input (Female micro USB), and a power switch with a red or blue LED above it. The LED functions are listed below:Alternating Re/Blue: Tunz is in pairing mode and ready to connect to your Bluetooth device.Solid Red: Tunz is being charged. Charging not complete.Solid Blue: Tunz is powered ON, or when being charged, charging is completed.I like that this speaker indicates when it is at full charge. I also like that you are able to, during use, to know what battery level is; by pressing the Bluetooth and Phone buttons for 2 seconds, you are told by your speaker that your battery is full, medium, or low. The bottom has the specifications of the speaker, which is below:MODEL: TUNZBK-T TYLTIC: 9092A-TUNZFCC ID: VL5-TUNZInput: DC 5V 0.5AOutput: DC 5V 1AMade in ChinaFull Specs:Input Voltage: 5V 0.5 Amp (Micro USB)Output Charging Current: 4.75V - 5.25V - 1 AmpLithium Ion Battery: 2,800 mAhBattery Charge Time: 6-7 HoursBluetooth: Version 3.0Output:80dB Max OutputConnectivity: 3.5mm Input and output jack / BluetoothTouch Controls: Volume, Play, Pause, Answer & End CallsWeight: 12.9 oz.Testing:The speaker came to me empty. I was able to successfully charge the speaker, from low to high, in 5 hours. This wasn&#8217;t a very fast charge, especially for a 2800mAh battery. I wish the battery would have charged faster. I then turned on the speaker to hear a loud, annoying sound. I honestly wish this was a feature you could turn off, or at least tone done. The noise is unnecessarily loud and shouldn&#8217;t be. I then attempted to connect the Bluetooth speaker with my desktop and laptop. I was able to successfully pair but both PCs were unable to install the proper Windows 7 Bluetooth drivers. I tried successfully paired the device with my Nexus 7 (2013) and an iPod 4th Generation. The sound that came out of both of the players was amazing. I could hear the bass very well, and can compare this speaker for Bose quality sound. The sound was loud enough that I needed to turn the volume down, which is a great plus. The buttons responded well to touch, and didn&#8217;t require me to press down hard. I was able to hear everything clearly within a range of 15 feet before hearing the crackling from being too far apart.I then tried to attach the auxiliary cord into the AUX IN port of the speaker. I was able to connect my computer with the speaker, but not in the way that I originally wanted. The sound was also clear. I lastly tried to connect the speaker and connect headphones into the AUX OUT port. I was unable to hear any sound from my headphones from the AUX OUT. This was disappointing, but I may have been misinformed how the AUX OUT works on this product.Lastly, I tested the 2800 mAh battery on my Nexus 7 (2013) running android 4.4.2, with a battery of 3950 mAh. This should charge the device 70.8% if the Nexus 7 were at 0% and the battery of the speaker at 100%. The results were as follows:11% to 24% in one hour before speaker stopped charging.I don&#8217;t know why the speaker stopped charging my tablet like it did, but it did. The speaker went from fully charged to &#8220;Medium&#8221;. Turning off and on the speaker will make my tablet say that it is charging for a few seconds before going to &#8220;Not charging&#8221; status. I am a little disappointed of the results, but I have a few batteries that can do the job for charging my tablet on the go.Closing:Overall, because of sound quality and overall build quality, I am happy with this product. The speaker performed well within a good distance without crackling. This should be the top choice for anyone that is interested in buying a Bluetooth speaker, and is why I give this product 5 stars.Pros:+ Compact and sleek, but packs a punch. Speaker is loud, and has nice bass, for the size and portability.+ No proprietary equipment required. Can be charged with any micro USB cable.+ Able to charge Smartphone or tablet with built in 2800 mAh battery.+ Buttons were very responsive, and didn&#8217;t require much effort for speaker to respond to touch.+ Durability of cables. Build quality of both micro USB and auxiliary cables are superior to cables I own.+ Customization. Able to change cover to red, blue, or black without buying any extra accessories.+ Includes AUX IN to make this speaker compatible with any non-Bluetooth device.+ Able to pair multiple devices with this device.Cons:- Sound for powering on and off device was obnoxiously loud.- Charger port only charged tablet for one hour before stopping. After the one hour of charge the speaker refused to charge tablet.- Black cloth bag was great idea but hard to fit speaker and cover inside; bag should have been bigger.- Could not install Tunz drivers to two computers.- Could not get AUX OUT to work with headphones.I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest and thorough review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51KnDZ4Ll5L._SY300_.jpg

Unfortunately, not everyone has the luxury to be completely cut off from civilization. For these people, New Trent has made the New Trent PowerPak Xtreme 12000mAh Rugged Water/Dirt/Shockproof Dual USB Port External Battery to charge USB devices that are low on power.Inside the packaging is a micro USB cable, the power bank and a user manual. My initial reaction to the power bank is how sturdy it is. The fact that it is water/dirt/shockproof makes me think that this is the ultimate camping power bank.The micro USB cord is 26 inches long. It has a hard plastic casing around the connectors, and silver plated connectors. The charger cord seems very durable.The power bank is small, but thick (5.2 X 2.8 x 1.2 inches) compared to similar power banks I have ownedRAVPower Deluxe External Battery Charger 14000mAh Portable Power Bank Pack - 4.8 x 0.8 x 3.2 inches. The outside material is made of a hard black plastic and body is a hard gray plastic. The top has a spot to clip a backpack onto it. The bottom has cover for the 5V 2.1A, 5V 1A, and micro USB ports, that can be pulled to open, and snapped back in to close. When the flap is closed, it looks like no water or anything can get into the USB ports. I really like that this requires a micro USB to charge this, which isn't proprietary. However, it does not have an included AC charger to charge this device. The right side has the New Trent logo. The left side has the name of the power bank &#34;Powerpak Xtreme NT10R&#34; and a button to show how much battery is left from the 4 blue LED indicators on the front bottom body (statuses below).4 Lights = 100%3 lights = 75%2 lights = 50%1 light = 25%The overall durability and construction of the power bank is well made. I would trust to take this power bank outside without worrying about falling or getting it wet, dirty, or muddy. I know this power bank can take more wear and tear than most power banks. I also like the way this power bank looks, and I think it is aesthetically pleasing.I then tested this power bank with my Nexus 7 (2013), running Andriod 4.2.2, with a 3950mAh battery, and a Kindle Fire 1st generation, running stock Kindle OS, with a 4400mAh battery. Both tablets were in idle, while charging from the 2.1A charger.

This external battery charged a total of 6031mAh, 1340mAh per hour, with a 67-100.% Efficiency. These are amazing results for a battery, as I have not tested a battery with efficiency this high or charging this fast! This external battery definitely is a top tier in my testing results.I would extremely recommend this product to anyone who is in the market for an external battery. Whether it would be indoor or outdoor, this battery excelled in every test, and is why I give this battery 5 out of 5 stars.Pros:+ Fast charging (6031mAh in 4.5 hours).+ Great efficiency (67-100.5%)+ Compact and light.

This leads to frustration to the user, unless the user buys an external battery like the Jackery Giant High-capacity Premium Aluminum 10400mAh External Battery.&#9654; Package Contents&#8226; Jackery Giant Battery Pack&#8226; USB-micro Charging Cable&#8226; User Guide&#8226; Warranty Card&#9654; AccessoriesThis device includes one 27 inch micro USB cable to charge the power bank and compatible mobile devices. I really like that this device uses the micro USB interface to charge, because this is the most common charging cable for mobile devices today, and is easily accessible at any electronics store.&#9654;  Specifications&#8226; Capacity: 10400mAh&#8226; Dimensions: 4.3 x 3.1 x 0.8 inch&#8226; Weight: 10.4 oz&#8226; Input: Micro USB 5V / 2.1A&#8226; Power indication: Three groups x 2 LED indicators&#9654; HardwareThe device is much smaller and then the description pictures make it look (4.3 x 3.1 x 0.8 inches; 15 ounces) despite the name being &#8220;Giant&#8221;. The device can come in either an orange or gray aluminum, which is a very sleek for an external battery. On the top face is the Jackery name and logo, and three LED indicators that notifies the charge to the user when the battery is being charged or the button is pressed on the right side of the battery.LED Statuses:&#8226; 1 LED blinking: level &#60; 10%&#8226; 1 LED on: level in 10%-33%&#8226; 2 LEDs on: level in 33%-66%&#8226; 3 LEDs on: level in 66%-100%At the top and bottom of the battery have a white gloss plastic, and on the top has an additional clear plastic layer. Both the top and bottom of the battery are fingerprint magnets, but the fingerprints are difficult to see unless you are specifically looking for fingerprints. At the top has an LED light, with what looks like a sun over, a micro USB port, with text under &#8220;IN&#8221;, a USB port, with the text over &#8220;5V 1A&#8221;, and a USB port, with the text over &#8220;5V 2.1A&#8221;. The LED light is enabled and disabled by pressing the power button twice. This light is very bright, but the visibility is no more than 3-4 feet from the two LED lights that create the &#8220;flashlight&#8221;. I also want to say that a flashlight shouldn&#8217;t make you decide whether to purchase a power bank or not, and should be the performance of the external battery instead. If you want an LED flashlight then pursue that opportunity separately. I overall like the design of this small but powerful battery. I think the LED indicator is a bit unconventional, but that is what makes this device unique from other battery manufacturers.&#9654; SetupSetup for this device is fairly simple. If you want to charge the battery, simply plug the micro USB into the appropriate port, and the USB into a computer, or for best results, a 2.1A USB wall charger. The time to charge a device on empty will take approximately 6 hours, but I received my battery with 2 LEDs and only required about an hour to fully charge. When the device has 3 full LED lights, you have completely charged your external battery.If you want to charge your mobile device, or USB charged device, then plug it into the USB port, and then press the power button to start charging.&#9654; TestingI started testing this device by charging my Nexus 7 (2013), with a 3950mAh battery, using stock Android 4.4.2. To activate the battery, press the button on the top face when the device is plugged in. When your device is plugged in, the LED light won&#8217;t show up unless you press the button on the device. This function seems counter intuitive for an external battery but it is probably done to save battery.Expected times to Charge Nexus 7: 10400mAh/3950mah = 2.63 Times (If battery were 100% Efficient)Power Bank Size * Expected Efficiency (70%) = Expected Charge / Nexus 7 (2013) Battery size = Expected Nexus 7 Charge10400mAh * 0.70 = 7280mAh/3950mAh = 184% Expected ChargeI then started testing the voltage and current with my Centech USB Power Mete. The results were as follows:&#8226; 2%:Current: 0.89AVoltage: 4.92VMax Current: 0.90AMinimum Required Voltage (To power): 4.82V&#8226; 86%:Current: 0.94AVoltage: 4.93VMax Current: 0.85AMinimum Required Voltage (To power): 4.83VThese are great results, as the Nexus 7 would take as much current from when the charge started as when the charge ended. I then tested and calculated the fast charge and efficiency by placing the Nexus 7 in idle, with no push notifications or processes running except system processes.Trial 1:Time: Nexus 7 Charge %2:24PM 2% - 3 LEDs2:44PM: 12%2:54PM: 16%3:24PM: 32%4:14PM: 57%4:42PM: 73%5:06PM: 86%5:22PM: 91%5:54PM: 100% - 2 LEDS SolidTrial 2:9:52PM: 7%10:23PM: 21%10:54PM: 37%11:24PM: 53%11:54PM: 68%12:01AM 73% - 1 LED Solid12:06AM 75% - 1 LED blinking12:19AM 82%12:33AM: 89%12:39AM: 91%12:43AM: 94% - 0 LED BlinkingTrial 1 Time + Trial 2 Time = 3.5 Hours + 3 Hours = 6.5 Hours Total TimeTrial 1 Charge + Trial 2 Charge = 88% + 87% = 175% (6912.5mAh) Total Charge0% Battery left on Jackery GiantCharge Per Hour:6912.5mAh/6.5h =1063 mAh per hourEfficiency:6912.5mAh/10400mAh =66.4 %The battery charged 6912.5mAh in 6.5 hours, or 1063 mAh per hour, which is above average considering I usually charge my device around 600-700mAh per an hour with my OEM 2.1A wall charger. The efficiency was 66.4%, which is on par with how well devices charge. Also we have to consider that the external battery lost some charge in the 4 hours that it was idle. I also want to note that around 12:01AM is when the LED indicator started showing without needing to press any button. Overall, these results are very good for an external battery.&#9654; Final ThoughtsThe main feature for this device is its high capacity, which it excelled in, because I was able to charge my Nexus 7 twice in a day. I highly recommend this device to anyone looking for a well crafted high capacity device, and is why I give this product a 5 star rating. I like the wide variety of external batteries that Jackery makes, as they are each well crafted from aluminum and hard plastic that come in a several sizes and capacity.Pros:+ A small, sleek, powerful, and overall aesthetically pleasing device that tested highly (1063mAh per hour; 66.4% Efficient). [See testing section for details]+ Maintains high current throughout entire charge; a feature that most chargers don&#8217;t have.+ Micro USB charging interface, the most common charging interface for mobile phones.+ Unique LED indicator design.+ LED &#8220;flashlight&#8221; is included but shouldn&#8217;t decide your choice for external battery, as they aren&#8217;t usually bright.Cons:- LED light will automatically show when charging the external battery, but not when charging your device.- Fingerprint magnet at top and bottom of device.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EXiPHOshL._SX300_.jpg

As technology evolves, its quality becomes much better. The Tylt Vu, without a doubt, is no exception to this rule. Its sleek design blows similar products out of the water! Inside the packaging comes an AC charger, the Vu, and instruction booklet.My first thoughts when opening the box was that this wireless charger was different. Most wireless chargers that you look on the market are flat, while this wireless charger has a vertical design. I have yet seen another manufacturer come up with this unique design. Not only does this device have a unique design, but it also is available in four different colors (Black, Blue, Green, or Red). Most manufacturers have only one color, while Tylt made it extremely appealing to the customer to choose what color suits them best.AC Adapter:The included AC charger cord is 68 inches long, with a brick attached at the end of it. The power supply adapter at the end blocks nearby horizontal outlets in my surge protector (3 x 1.25 x 2 inches). I wish there would have been an adapter in the middle of the AC cord, than at the end where the outlets were. On the bottom of the power bricks reads the following specifications, which are listed below:Model No: S15A02Input: 100-240V50-60Hz 0.3AOutput: 12V = 0.75AMade in China By SolcompTylt Vu:As said earlier, the Tylt Vu has a vertical design. This is done by taking two sides of a triangle without the bottom side. For the sake of this review I will be calling the two sides: front side, and back side. The size of the Vu is 7.5 x 3.5 x 3.5 inches, with each side a thickness of 0.5 inches. This wasn&#8217;t made as a compact charger for traveling; instead this would be the charger you&#8217;d use at home. The plastic material is a very nice matt black, which doesn&#8217;t feel in any way cheap. The front of the front side has the Tylt logo at the center, the stand at the bottom, and under the stand is the LED light which will either be off, green, or red. The statuses are listed below:When green: ChargingWhen off: StandbyWhen red: Error!The Tylt Vu will sometimes error, which indicates that your device isn&#8217;t charge correctly. If the LED stays solid red, removing and placing your Qi compatible device back on the pad or unplugging and re-plugging the 12V AC adapter will correct this issue. If the LED blinks red, then the Tylt Vu has automatically fixed its issue, and will turn green. I really like the placement of the LED light as it will always be visible. On other Qi chargers, my tablet overshadows any LED indicator, which is a bit frustrating if you have successfully connected or not. Under the LED is a rubberized foot, so the Tylt Vu will avoid slipping on whatever surface it is on.The front of the backside contains a small hole at the bottom so the AC charger cord can successfully move through without putting the Vu off balance. The back of the backside has two screws at the top to put this device together, followed by specifications of the Vu:Tylt LogoModel: VUBK-TInput: DC12 = 750mAOutput: 5WFCC ID: SZQ-T100Wireless Power by FIDTMade in ChinaThe specs state that this wireless charger only charges at 750mA (0.75A), which is disappointing, considering most AC adapters charge at least 1A or more, and this includes a compact Qi charger that I have. I wish this device would charge at least at 1A. The bottom of the same hole, as seen from backside has the slot for the small 12V connection cord, and two rubberized feet on each side. The 12V connection from the charger cord is very small and difficult to install. This would be a tedious task if the LED light was solid red and you needed to reinsert the cord.Testing:I tested this device with my Nexus 7 (2013). This device is using a rooCase case (http://www.amazon.com/rooCASE-Google-Nexus-FHD-Case/dp/B00E3ZYWUM/) running android 4.4.2, with a battery of 3950mAh. I placed the device with my case, in landscape, and at first didn&#8217;t charge. I had to reinsert the charger cord, and then placed the tablet again, which charged successfully! This charger unfortunately doesn&#8217;t charge my tablet in portrait, but I have finally found a Qi Charger that can successfully charge my tablet with a case on! I charged it from 23% to 37% in one hour, and then 37% to 56% in the second hour. As long as I get more than 5 hours of sleep, my tablet will be fully charged, and that is what makes this Qi charger worth it. Also, the positioning of the charger allows me to watch Youtube and Netflix without needing to move my tablet, which provides a great media experience. This is a great extra feature, which is icing on the cake!Closing:This Qi charger is for owners that want more than just any Qi charger. The quality design, choice of colors, and compatibility with cases makes this the perfect Qi charger. This should be the top choice for anyone that is interested in buying a Qi charger and is why I give this product 5 stars. If I had the opportunity to give more stars, I would do it.Pros:+ Compatible with my Nexus 7 (2013) case!+ Unique design. I have yet to see a Qi Charger that has a vertical design.+ Choice of colors: Black, Blue, Green, Yellow+ Build of Vu is very nice and doesn&#8217;t feel cheap.+ LED Placement doesn&#8217;t get covered when tablets are placed on; less frustration compared to other Qi chargers.+ Design allows you to watch media comfortably.Cons:- AC Charger blocks nearby outlets.- Only charges devices at 750mA.- 12V charger connector is difficult to install, which makes it tedious if you were to reinsert the cord.I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest and thorough review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31LvyBFAD9L._SY300_.jpg

The entire test took approximately 2.66 hours, charging 3239mAh in total, or 1217.66mAh per an hour. This time is very fast, considering my Nexus 7 usually charges around only 600-700mAh with the OEM charging cable in a 2.1A charger. The only issue is the efficiency, which was only 64.78% efficient, which can be excused due to the charger only being 1A instead of the full 2.1A that the tablet is rated for. These results are very good for my Nexus 7, and prove that this small charger can overcome even the goliaths of batteries.I then tested the time to charge the external battery:11:00AM: - Red12:49PM: - Blue3:11PM: - Green Blinking7:00PM: - Green SolidIt took approximately 8 hours to charge this battery, which is past the 6 hour suggestion, but within an acceptable range for an external battery.&#61656; Final ThoughtsThe main feature for this device is the portability, which should be the reason why you want to buy this product. If you can get around the $60 price tag, then I would extremely recommend this product to you, because of how fast this charges your device. Because of these features, I give this product a 5 star rating. This has to be my favorite small battery, because I haven&#8217;t seen something like this.Pros:+ A small, light, sleek, and overall aesthetically pleasing device that tested highly (1217.66mAh per hour; although only 64.78% efficient). [See testing section for details]+ The point needs to be made that this is probably the one of the smallest 5000mAh charger you can find on the market.+ Multicolor LED indicator+ Micro USB charging interface, the most common charging interface for mobile phones.Cons:- LED light will automatically show when charging the external battery, but not when charging your device.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31y9oFugQHL._SX300_.jpg

However, the future is now. Now manufacturers are making Smartphones and Tablets that are &#34;Qi-compliant&#34; (see below for compatible devices) or devices that are able to be charged wirelessly. RAVPower has introduced the &#34;Orbit&#34; to suit devices that are compatible with such charging.I received this item, and upon unboxing I found the Orbit Qi Charger, a 1.5A AC Adapter, and an instruction booklet. My first thought was that the box and the contents inside were very compact and squeezed inside, RAVPower made sure that this product wouldn't move during shipment, which is reassuring. My second thought was that everything in the box was white, while all of my electronics are black, and RAVPower only makes this in one color. This isn't that big of an issue though.The included 1.5A AC charger (1.375 x 0.875 x 2.875 inches) has a white matt finish and sticks straight up. It has the USB port at the top with a green LED light on the front, indicating that the AC charger is on. I like that this includes an AC adapter, but wish that the adapter had a smaller width. It fits in my power outlet but not my surge protector, as neighboring power cords are blocking the adapter of fitting in the surge protector but not the power outlet.My first impression of the Orbit (2.8 x 0.8 x 2.8 inches) itself is that it is very small. It has a white gloss finish with a small rubberized ring at the center. It was made with traveling in mind. The USB cord is wrapped around the Orbit, and the USB itself is placed under the hub. When it is fully wrapped you should only see the Orbit itself. This is a very nice feature, however, the cord itself is a very small gauged wire, which makes me scared to bend and break the wire. This is a concern, because the cord bends at junction of where the USB slot is. This means usual wear and tear while traveling may break the wire, making the Orbit is inoperable. There is a small led light on the front of the device which will blink red when no charging a device, and alternate between red and green when charging a device.I tested this device with my Nexus 7 (2013), which is Qi-compatible. I connected the Orbit to the AC charger and then placed my device with my case (http://www.amazon.com/MoKo-Google-New-Nexus-Case/dp/B00DLZVG4K/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1391192210&sr;=8-2) onto the Orbit. The Orbit did nothing and my tablet said it wasn't charging. This was disappointing to hear, because I wanted the convenience of not removing the case, even though I knew adding a case would make the charging slower. I have since ordered a new case that reviewers claim to wireless charge their devices. I continued my testing without any case on my Nexus 7 and placed it on the charger and then nothing happened. I had to move my Nexus 7 around for a few moments before I heard the beep that indicated my devices was connected successfully. My Nexus 7 definitely overshadows the device. You can't see the led light unless you look under the Nexus 7, which shows again how portable the Orbit is. You also notice the rubberized non-slip when moving the tablet around. I wish there were rubberized feet on the bottom of the charger but that was probably a move to cut costs. I tried to charge my tablet a few times with this device, and you can definitely notice how much slower it charges (20-30% more wait time compared to standard connector chargers) but the convenience of not messing with the charger port of my tablet right before bed is a great plus. Less connections to the Micro USB port on my tablet saves the port from daily wear and tear, gives the cord the opportunity to be used on other devices, and gives the opportunity to use an OTG cable which would otherwise not be possible.Because people were wondering about which devices can and can't be used, I have included what the instruction booklet notes:&#34;Please confirm your cell phone manufacturer that your phone is Qi-compliant. If it is, and it has a built-in Qi wireless receiver, the RAVPower wireless charger can charge the device directly. For example, phones such as the Nexus 7 2nd Gen, Nexus 4, HTC 8X, HTC Droid DNA, Nokia Lumia 920, LG Optimus Vu2 come Qi-compliant. If your phone does not have a built-in Qi wireless receiver, please install one...Examples of phones that do not come with a Qi wireless receiver are the Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300, Note 3, and Note 2. If your device needs a charging back cover, install a back cover that has a wireless receiver and the charger will function properly. Examples of phones that need a back charging cover are the HTC ONE X, HTC G11 (incredible S), iPhone 4/4s, iPhone 5/5S/5C, and SONY Xperia Aero S&#34;Overall, I recommend this product to anyone who is in the need for convenience. Products like this one are showing the future of electronics, and the benefits of investing one of these devices. For the price @ $35.99, portability, and quality from a company like RAVPower, this is a steal. Similar devices may be cheaper but don&#8217;t have the same build quality, and are much bulkier.Pros:+ Price is great for the build quality+ Portable, compact, and easy to take wherever you go.+ No need to add additional cords, as everything is included+ 1.5A AC Charger included, which is a huge plus because many Qi Chargers don&#8217;t include such things.+ Rubberized ring on circle to avoid devices from slipping+ LED indicators and beep to know your device is connected without having to check your device.Cons:- Wasn&#8217;t able to be used with my current case, which made me have to search for a compatible case.- Nexus 7 (2013) didn&#8217;t automatically find the Qi contact. Had to move around tablet until beep was heard. This may be a negative to the Nexus 7 and not the Orbit.- Small gauged wire, which may result in ripping and the device to be obsolete- QI charging is slower than corded charging (20-30%).- Included AC adapter is awkward shaped and unable to be placed in surge protectors.I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest and thorough review.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31pqyxrQhlL._SX300_.jpg

Everyone either has an Android or Apple device, and many times we aren&#8217;t within range of an outlet to charge our device. Fortunately RAVPower has made the RAVPower Luster 6000mAh External Battery to suit the common person whom requires a little extra charge for their smart device.Inside the packaging is the Luster External Batter, a micro USB charger, a carrying bag, and an instruction manual. RAVPower has not only made a compact power bank but an aesthetically pleasing one that comes in four colors: Black, Blue, Gold, or Pink. I chose Black, as it is what I prefer most of my electronics to be.The coiled micro USB charger can be stretched to 24 inches, but I could only personally stretch it to 20.5 inches before the coiled wire became resistant to stretching. It is great that this only includes one connector, unlike the larger versionRAVPower Deluxe External Battery Charger 14000mAh. The larger version includes several unneeded connectors, which are prone to losing. Because this version has no connectors, the chance of an important connector isn&#8217;t as great. I wish they would also include an AC charger, but I understand they did this to cut costs.This also includes a cloth mesh bag, which not many power banks include. This is great, as it keeps the power bank and all of its contents from being lost or damaged. It is a feature that all RAVPower &#8220;Deluxe&#8221; brand power banks possess, which adds sophistication that I personally love.The power bank itself is very small (3.9 x 0.8 x 1.6 inches) and is very light (4.3 ounces). It can easily fit any pocket, purse, or back pack without irritating the user. It has a mat black (in my case) finish, with a silver button, a ring of silver at the top, and gray faces for the front and back. The front has the RAVPower logo, a button to activate the power bank (quickpress) or flashlight (3 second press), and under the silver ring is a place for up to 4 blue LED indicators to light up (Listed below).4 Lights On = 75-100%3 Lights On = 50-75%2 Lights On = 25-50%1 Light On = &#60;25%I have seen the indicators blink, and can safely assume 4 solid lights on is fully charged. These LED indicators are somewhat difficult to see in light, as they are under the silver coated plastic. On the top is one 5V 2.1A USB port, one flashlight, and one micro USB port to charge the device. I like that this uses a micro USB cable to charge the device, instead of proprietary charging, as most Android devices require to be charged by micro USB.  On the bottom are the specs for this power bank:RAVPowerSeries/Model: Luster/ RP-PB17Capacity: 6000mAhInput: 5V/1.5A (Max)Output: 5V/2.1A (Max)Made in ChinaI then tested this using Kindle Fire 1st generation, running stock Kindle Fire&#8217;s modified android OS, with a 44000mAh battery. I tested this with my tablet idling, running no applications or processes. My results are below:7:34pm 7%9:00pm 61%10:00pm 97%In 2.5 hours, my Kindle went from 308mAh to 4268mAh, or 3960mAh total, averaging 1584mAh. These are amazing results for such a small charger in such a short time.3960mAh / 6000mAh = 66% efficientThe total efficiency is around 66% efficient, which is great for an external battery. This is as expected from a company like RAVPower.Overall, I recommend this power bank to any individual needing a compact power bank to charge their device, and is why I give this product 5 out of 5 stars.Pros:+ Compact and light; Can easily fit in any pocket, purse, or back pack without irritating the user.+ Aesthetically pleasing power bank that comes in four color colors (Black, Blue, Gold, or Pink).+ Multifunctional button to either activate power bank or flashlight.+ Uses micro USB instead of proprietary wires. Most android devices require micro USB charging.+ Includes one coiled micro USB wire.

Fortunately companies like RAVPower are making products like the RAVPower Qi-Enabled Wireless Charger / 4800mAh External Battery Pack Charger in order to charge devices wirelessly or by USB.Inside the package is the wireless charger/external battery, a micro USB cable, an AC adapter, and the user manual. This is the first wireless charger with an external battery pack that I have seen. I really like the combination for when you are at home or on the go. This is a really unique device to use wherever you go.The included AC charger is quite tall (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.9 inches). The charger does block neighboring outlets but this charger would only be used when the wireless charger would be in use or when the external battery needs charged. I like that this external battery includes an AC charger. The top end has the USB pot for charging the device and the bottom has the outlet plug. On the front face is a green LED to indicate the AC charger is on. On the opposite end are the specs for the AC charger:AC/DC AdapterModel: JHD-AP012U-05015ABInput: 100-240V 50/60Hz0.35AOutput: 5V 1500mAThis charger is unfortunately only a 1.5A port, instead the maximum possible of 2.1A, but at least RAVPower includes the AC adapter.The included micro USB cord is 32 inches long. The guage of the wire isn&#8217;t thick or thin, which is durable enough with normal wear and tear. I like that this wireless charger/external battery includes the micro USB interface as it is a very common cord that can be bought at any electronics store if it is ever damaged, lost, or stolen.The RP-WCN11 is small (6.8 x 5.2 x 2.7 inches) and light (11.2 ounces). Its basically the size of a large phone. The model I have is the matt black version, which is very stylish. I like that this model comes in two colors because I prefer my electronics to be black over white. On the top face is the RAVPower logo, on top of that is a rubberized ring with a power symbol in it. This is where you would place your wireless device. Unfortunately, not many devices are Qi compatible. Please check if your device is compatible before buying this product. On the right bottom corner of the front face are 6 LED lights (statuses below):Qi charging:Red and Green Led blinkingCharging external batter:One Blue LED = 25%Two Blue LED = 50%Three Blue LED = 75%Four Blue LED = 100%Wired charging:Red light is solidAt any time the LEDs may be blinking. If 3 solid blue LED and one blinking blue LED then that indicates a 75-100% charge. This is a good indicator for charging mobile devices.On the bottom is the micro USB port to charge the external battery, a USB port to charge any device, and a button to indicate the charge of the external battery.RAVPowerWireless ChargerModel: RP-WCN11Input: 5V 1500mAOutput: 5V 1500mABattery capacity: 4800mAhMade in ChinaCharging this device is very simple. Simply connect the micro USB into the micro USB port of the wireless charger, and the USB into a computer or the included AC adapter. The device will now be charging its battery and can wirelessly charge at this time as well.I then tested the external battery by connecting it to my Kindle Fire 1st generation, running default kindle OS, which has a 4400mA battery. The Kindle is idle with no running apps. In theory, this should charge my device 1.1 times. The results were as follows:11:39am 20%12:38pm 43%1:22pm 60% - Took break7:25pm 65% - Started charging again8:01pm 76%8:30pm 79%9:03pm 94%9:20pm 100%1 LED left.75 x 4400mA = 3300mA3300mA/4 hours = 825mA per hour.25 x 4400mA = 1100mA825mA/1100mA = 75%In about 4 hours the battery charged 75%, which is 3300mA total or 825mA per hour. This battery is up to 75% efficient, which is great for any battery pack. I would recommend this battery pack alone.I then tested the wireless charger with my Nexus 7 (2013), running Android 4.2.2, with a 3950mA battery. The Nexus 7 is idle with no running apps. When I placed the Nexus 7 onto the wireless charger, I was unable to see any of the lights on the top of the charger. This is unfortunate for larger devices as they will block the external battery indicators. The results were as follows:10:04pm 1%10:55pm 17%12:20am 43%1:31am 66%In about 2.5 hours this wireless charger charged 2607mA total, or 1042.8mA per hour. These are great results from a wireless charger, considering the 1.5A AC charger was used. This would have probably charged faster if a 2.1A charger was used.I recommend this device to anyone who is looking for an external battery/wireless charger. This is a very unique device that can be used at home or on the go, and is why I give this product 5 out of 5 stars.Pros:+ A wireless charger that can be taken on the go as a battery pack! A great unit for at home or on the go.+ External battery pack is very efficient (75%)+ Wireless charger is very fast (1042.8mA per hour)+ Battery pack charges while wireless charger is charging.+ LED indicators that tell you when the battery is low or fully charged.+ Uses a micro USB interface for charging, which is a very common cord that is available at any electronics store if it is damaged, lost, or stolen.+ Simple to charge and discharge.+ Slip resistant top for Qi charging.+ Lightweight and compact+ Choice of two colors (White or black)Cons:- Larger devices block the LEDs for indicating external battery charge.- AC charger does block neighboring outlets.- AC adapter is only 1.5A instead the maximum possible of 2.1A.- Not all devices are Qi compatible. Check your device if it can be wirelessly charged.I was provided a sample in exchange for an honest and thorough review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31lqJQmyC2L._SY300_.jpg

This product comes in white or black, with two USB ports on the front (2.1A and 1A), iClever logo on the size, and a retractable plug in the back.

(TwinPack: Black + White),"Sometimes our fingers are too large and inaccurate to do tasks on our mobile devices, for times like this New Trent has made the New Trent Arcadia Clickpen Stylus.&#9654; Package Contents2 x New Trent Arcadia Clickpen Stylus&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Microfiber tip (retractable)&#8226; Twin pack (black and white)&#8226; Dimension: 4.5&#34; (extended) 4.3&#34; (retracted) (L)x 0.3&#34; (Dia) inch&#9654; HardwareAs stated in the specifications, the Stylus is 4.5&#8221; extended, 4.3&#8221; retracted, and 0.3&#8221; diameter. This stylus comes in two colors, black and white, which are both included in the package. The top of the stylus is the clicker, which moves the microfiber in or out. This is a really good feature, as you are able to keep your tip protected from damage. Under the clicker is the pocket protector holder, and at the end is the Microfiber tip. Unlike the New Trent Limir, the pocket protector for this product doesn&#8217;t detract to any feature of the stylus, and the body is one piece instead of two. This creates a better feel as a stylus. The biggest draw to buy this product is the microfiber tip, which is supposed to be compatible with any capacitive touch surface. Capacitive touch surfaces are a newer technology, which replaces resistive touch, a technology used by first generation touch screens and sub $50 mobile devices. Now, you may be thinking, &#8220;Don&#8217;t all styluses have this functionality?&#8221; The simple answer is, &#8220;No.&#8221; There are several companies that create cheaper styluses, with rubber tips, which are less responsive and not compatible with every capacitive touch screen. Overall, I like the construction of this stylus, and the microfiber tip.&#9654; TestingI tested the stylus with my Nexus 7 (2013), Samsung Galaxy Rush, Nintendo 3DS, and Zune HD. As expected, the stylus worked on every screen I attempted to use it with, unlike the rubber tip styluses I&#8217;ve used in the past. When I opened a drawing app on each device, the stylus was very comfortable and accurate to the touch. I actually prefer the feel of this stylus over the New Trent Limir, which is a stylus pen, because of it being one piece. I was satisfied by the results of this stylus.&#9654; Final ThoughtsI overall like the functions of this device, as the tip is retractable to avoid damage. I was able to successfully use this stylus with every device, which matches the claims. Because of the functionality of the stylus, I recommend this product to anyone who needs a stylus and give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ A very well built stylus pen, comfortable, and tested well with all my products.+ Compatible with all capacitive touch screens.Cons:I have no cons for this device.Sensitivity: 5/5Drag ability: 5/5Flexibility: 5/5Comfort: 5/5",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HQdEWB5qL._SX300_.jpg

The base mounts a 2.5&#8221; x 2.5&#8221; suction cup about 0.1&#8221; to 0.2&#8221; inward, activated by the clip that has the Aukey logo. This suction cup is approximately 3&#8221; inches from the ball, which connects to the spiral and phone holder to 4 prong base adapter, which connects to the 4&#8221; x 2&#8221; holder. The actual holder is released by the button on the right side, which releases the two flaps, capable of holding phones up to 4.75&#8221; wide.

Press the side button to release the phone.&#9654; TestingI tested this holder for approximately two days, or about 16 hours, using my Samsung Galaxy Rush, a 4.5&#8221; inch phone. The phone successfully fit overnight and during a 3 hour drive, without falling or moving out of place, however, due to the design of the device, the volume buttons became obstructed by the side flaps. Other than this minor issue, I was pleased by the tests of this device.&#9654; Final ThoughtsIf you are using a smaller phone, and volume control is an important feature, then I wouldn&#8217;t get this device, otherwise, I would recommend this device to you and give this a 5 star rating. The mount is made well, fit well, and is capable of giving you an optimal view of your phone.Pros:+ A well made phone holder, capable of holding my phone for long periods of time.Cons:- Due to the design, my smaller phone&#8217;s volume keys were obstructed by the side flaps.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JW6WZcolL._SY300_.jpg

The Empower is a bit taller and heavier which make it tend to droop.  It is not likely to fall as the suction cup seems to be strong enough to hold its weight.- I prefer a regular microUSB charging cable because if I lose the cable I can easily find a replacement.

I am not new to glass protectors though, and since I have been introduced to them, I am not going back to plastic screen protectors anymore.  First of all, it is almost impossible to have a complete bubble free and lint free application with a plastic screen protector.  With glass protectors, just make sure that your phone screen is clean (using the included microfiber cloth) and you can put a glass protector painless without any bubbles.You get the complete kit, cleaning wipe, microfiber cloth, deducting strips and a blue static cling.  Once you are sure that the surface of the phone is clean, carefully peel off the plastic from the glass protector and then lay it carefully making sure all the holes are in the right places.  Gently tap the center and the screen protector will stick itself onto your phone.You wont feel any change in the phone's responsiveness.  It is still as quick as if you don't have any protector at all.  In fact, you won't hardly notice that there is a screen protector at all.

If you are buying this for your iPhone to charge wirelessly, it won't.  It will charge your iPhone because it has 2 USB slots on the side to plug your cable and onto your iPhone.  There are chargers that can do it wirelessly but it requires a special battery case paired with a charging pad and costs much more.For Androids, this works with your Qi charging system.  It will do the job.  Just lay your phone on top and it will start juicing up.Cons:I find the two USB slots substandard.  I have to push it in a certain angle just to accommodate the cable.  It won't even go in at first because the metal on the top is blocking it.Overall, the quality of the charger is sub par, but for the price (under 20 bucks  at the time of this review) I think it is not a bad deal. 3.5 stars.Sample item was provided for review purposes.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-Lp2fHdjL._SY300_.jpg

You can turn it on by a small slider switch on the side.  It will emit an ascending series of beeps, somewhat loud but not as disturbingly loud as other Bluetooth speakers I had before.For speakers of this size, it sound very decent.  It is unexpectedly loud for its size.  I really like that I can control the volume easily right through the speaker.  Some Bluetooth speakers require that you have to hold the volume button to adjust which is annoying as it is very difficult to control how loud or how soft the volume is before you can release your finger, while some doesn't even have a volume control.The pairing process is quite easy.  The front grill has three buttons, the plus and minus signs are for volume, and the square sign (multifunction button) is for pairing.  First press the square sign for about 6 seconds or until the LED starts flashing red and blue in succession.  Turn on Bluetooth on your device and you will find it as SB-100. If it asks for a password, enter 0000.What is in the box?Bluetooth speaker, micro USB cable, 3.5 mm to 3.5 mm audio cable, an AC adapter (100-240V/1A) and a manual.The box and packaging is nice which makes it a nice gift item.I just find it funny that the volume up is on the left instead on the right.

The Lightning cable is about three feet long and is made of thicker gauge cable.  I tried flipping the 8-pin connector and it worked on both direction, which is what it supposed to be like the original Apple Lightning cable.I really love the dashboard no-skid pad that came with it.  I bought one before and you just lay your phone on top and it won't budge an inch.  If it gets dirty, you just wash it with soap and water and it is sticky again.The cigarette car adapter works universally.  iPhone or Android.  It has two slots that you can use at the same time.  Total amperage is 3.1A.The only thing I didn't like is the excess packaging. I like it more minimalistic with less foam and less plastic.

Once I turned it on (the slide switch is located at the back), it automatically started the pairing process and my PC was able to locate it and connect.Quick specs:Bluetooth 2.12 x 2W driversCharging time 2-3 hrs (BL-5C 850 mAh battery)3 hrs of playback for a full charge150 Hz to 20 Khz frequency10% THDAux in (3.5 mm audio cable included)Headphone portThere are some inconsistencies with the included manual. 1) It says it has FM radio but no matter how I press the Mode button, it won't go to FM radio mode 2) The power button is a slider switch at the back and not the Mode button.Pro:- Good audio. Clean and loud for a small speaker.- Uses a replaceable BL-5C 850 mAh Li-ion battery.Cons:- My biggest gripe is how the volume buttons needs to be pressed and held to adjust. Either you turn it mute or all the way loud before you have a chance to lift off your finger.- Unstable. I think the elongated football shape design looks neat but it also resulted into a smaller base footing. It can topple off the table with just a little nudge.I suggest to take a look at the other BT speaker from the same manufacturer - B00CJRZ31S",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zw5Yu2JrL._SY300_.jpg

Just from the looks of it I was already in doubt. So I had to run a couple of tests without the phone in it.  I dropped this in a bowl of water and it did keep out the water from the enclosed space and it worked well for that part but water can easily pass through the case if you mess with the top of the case or shake it around hard enough.  By messing with the top part of the case, I mean if it isn't fully sealed (which it feels like it will stretch over time) it will allow water to go through.I left it in the bowl for 5 minutes untouched and fully sealed and it did not allow one drop of water in.  However, once I happen to just flick the top of the case, water drops started to enter visibly on the interior screen case in less than a minute and in 5 minutes I had a small pool of water inside.  I think if they had a way to ensure  that the top did not flick open so easily it would have been perfect.  There is no way I'd put my phone in the water intentionally like to take pictures or something but this definitely will help prevent any water damage in the first place if I happen to fall off a jet ski or something.

I decided to put my old camera inside and see if it worked if I just happen to put it in the bowl again and it worked!  No problems whatsoever.

It's probably the one and only one that would actually replace all your other wall chargers.  The 4 ports are all very powerful to charge all tablets and phones at the same time at great time.  I was able to charge my ipad 2, samsung note 2, galaxy s3 and battery pack all at once and they charged about 1% per minute for the samsung note 2 and galaxy s3.What I really like is the cord distance.  I really like the fact that the cord is long enough to tuck your charger somewhere else.  For me, I am now finally able to use the port behind my bed and have it reach my nightstand.  The size of this charger is fairly small (about 3 x 2). The design is very slick and modern.  It really would match any area with a touch of style for a charger.  Overall, great charger.

It's a little on the weak side when it comes to output but it makes up for it in design.  This has a 5V1A output which I consider to be a little on the weak side.  I wish they had a 2amp port but they don't and it's just a personal preference.  I think in this day and age it's a little behind however, this is just a personal preference.I really like the fact that there top and bottom have non-slip surfaces.  I was able to put my Note 2 phone on top of it and it didn't slip when I tried to push it off.  I realize this is small but very smart of them to do.  This is important to me because everytime I charge my phone on my desk, I always try to take up the least amount of space possible so I always stack my phone on my chargers, this is perfect for someone like me because now, it doesn't tip over when I do that.  I realize that this is probably for the Qi function of it but it works great for me =)The size of this is nice too and it's light weight which is also very nice. I was able to charge 5% in the time I wrote this review which is pretty impressive even though its 1amp.  All in all this is a great design.

So I wasn't able to review this completely so I may have to revise this later but so far I am very happy with this. I took this on a cruise instead of my travel wall charger and it was a 4 day cruise. I had 7 people with me and we all were able to charge our phones and still be able to use it with battery life at the end of the cruise. This is a super powerful one. There is one real down size to this which is that you are only able to charge one thing a a time. There is only one outlet so that's the only real bad thing and I wasn't able to charge my samsung laptop because the adapters did not fit so I'll have to find one that fits. I left a message to the seller and I'm assuming from our conversation that he is sending one.Other than that it's a great charger. It's heavy but well worth it for a long term traveler.

The package box shows the speaker with a clock on it but on the product itself there is no clock function or at least no real way to get to it.  The package does not include any instructions so basically you'll have to catch on by playing around with it.On the back of it, there is a port for you to dock a flash drive of some sort to play mp3's and only mp3s. Just by looking at its size, you would imagine that it would be fairly loud but it isn't as loud as I thought it could be - this could be a personal preference but I am comparing this to comparable sized speakers.All the buttons on screen on capacitive buttons. The second you turn it on, it goes to bluetooth mode and is ready for pairing.  The connection is easy and works well and it can even accept phone calls.  You can switch functions by hitting the &#34;M&#34; button. which has the FM mode, Line mode, and mp3 function.  All the modes work fine but the FM mode.  What I find hard and difficult to use is the FM mode.  Once you are in the FM mode, you would imagine that the tuner buttons (left and right arrows) would change the station but they do not.  I keep getting stuck on 87.5 FM and it will not change.  I've tried every button on that screen and nothing seems to work.

The rubberized covered magnet was a smart design and a simple one which I really like.There were two small comments I have to make about it that I didn't like.The magnetic hold isn't strong enough to hold a phone when on a rigorous road with a lot of bouncing (although rare for most people,  I thoughti should note it) - it week fall off.

People who use the USB ports on the computer or older wall chargers with only 2.1 A will really appreciate the faster charging times for devices that can accommodate 4 A.  The higher output is maintained even when all four USB ports are in use.Those ports are underneath to ease cord tangle and strain and are clearly labelled. All are universal for use with most devices including the newer ones from Apple.  One is also designed to also be compatible with older Apple devices and another with Samsung devices but not with iPad.  It sounds confusing, but iPad and Galaxy owners are familiar with these issues!To get the best use from any USB charger, it is important to understand the requirements of each device and its battery. Manufacturers provide this information; Apple's website, for instance, provides a full page of information about each device's battery. iPad batteries should be completely discharged and then fully recharged monthly, while iPod batteries don't need to be cycled. Some electronics should be turned off or put in sleep mode for charging under certain circumstances. It definitely is worth the time to learn about these requirements.This Bolse wall charger works very well as a permanent charging station but it is also convenient for travel.  It weighs 4 oz. and is just a tad over 3 in. long.  The offset non-polarized prongs are well-protected but are easy to unfold, and they are secure in the wall outlet or power strip.

The body is made of durable metal with a chromed band and it comes in several different colors.It comes with a very handy 3 in. by 5 in. mesh drawstring accessory bag in a lovely blue color. It is large enough to hold the power bank, the charging cable, and the two adapter tips.

The power in & out ports and four blue LED indicators to show power status in 25% increments are on the end with the chromed band.The control button is also near that end. Just push this button to begin charging an electronic device. This is a critical step that many first-time power bank users forget!This is a handy little power bank and it is easy to recommend it based on portability and function, but I must admit that my favorite thing about it is the fun colors to choose from!

The Omi-10 also comes with a USB wall charger, short cable, charging tips, and a very nice zippered travel case to keep all the accessories together.I suggest using a USB wall adapter to recharge this power bank because of the large capacity, as it will be much faster than most all USB ports.Omi Labs provided a sample of the Ox-10 for testing and impartial review.

It has a soft-touch plastic body and is pretty tough&mdash;when I dropped it on the bathroom floor, it wasn't damaged at all.  It has an attractive rounded pear-shaped form and comes in several bright colors as well as neutrals.  There is a hook that swivels all the way around and tilts from side to side in a 90 degree range.  This lets it hang securely from the neck of the shower head or faucet handle, a towel bar, hook, or pool chair.The shell is IPX-4 rated, which is splash-resistant for five minutes.  I let water from the faucet run over it for two minutes without any problems&mdash;just make sure the plug on the charging port is sealed tightly.  When the speaker holes are full of water, the sound is dampened, but this is not a problem during actual use and it is easy enough to shake the water out.It took me a few minutes playing around with it to figure out the controls although there is an instruction sheet included&mdash;think of it as a little puzzle to solve. There are four buttons with icons and the trick is that quickly pressing or holding down a button initiates different functions.  The power button also changes it from speaker to radio and the volume buttons change the track.The battery charges fully overnight and then will last well over two weeks if used for about half an hour daily.  It pairs instantly with Bluetooth as BST-19, no PIN needed, but it's less fuss to just use the radio, which is perfect for news in the morning.  The LED flashes when in pairing mode.The three watt speaker is more than loud enough for use in the shower. The sound reproduction is not audiophile quality, of course, but there is no noticeable distortion at normal volumes.  Overall, it is very good for a mono 3 watt speaker and works just fine for music, talk radio, and for the telephone function.  I was not expecting it to have a telephone function, but when paired with a smartphone, it allows calls to be answered.A sample was provided for testing and unbiased review.  It has been lots of fun to listen to this radio in the shower.  It would also be nice for listening to audiobooks or even language lessons to make good use of time spent in the bathroom.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TW2dNSnTL._SY300_.jpg

It doesn&#8217;t interfere with reception or use of the phone as all the openings are in the right spot;  the only exception would be with some docks or wide audio jacks.

Not only does it have a 2000 mAh battery that in practice almost doubles the capacity of an iPhone 5S, it charges wirelessly when laid on the power pad and allows data transfer by USB rather than Lighting cable.  It also protects the iPhone all around from bumps and scratches and reduces fingerprints.What surprised me is that it is less than 5/8 in. thick.  It still looks thin, but with the rounded edges and soft touch finish, the Aero case makes the iPhone much easier to handle and more comfortable to hold, especially for long periods of time.  The case is very easy to fit onto the phone and to remove.The power pad is very convenient and extra ones are available.  The icon on the screen and the LED both signal that it is charging and it charges both the iPhone battery and the Aero battery.  It can also be charged from a USB port or USB wall charger without using the power pad.There are LED indicators for remaining reserve capacity.  To recharge the iPhone, just hold down the button on the back of a case for a few seconds.A pigtail extender for the audio port is included so that a standard Apple-compatible headset can be used with the case on the phone.  All other functions are readily accessible.A sample was provided for testing and unbiased review.  I definitely recommend the uNu Aero for providing almost double battery life, wireless charging, and an attractive and functional case, all in one well-designed and -manufactured accessory.  It makes the iPhone better.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31R6f3SCbNL._SY300_.jpg

The bass gets a noticeable boost if the speaker is placed a few inches in front of a vertical service.The design is straightforward and setup is fast and easy.  On the right end are the power port, audio-in port, and the power switch.  On the front are volume buttons and a button that initiates Bluetooth pairing when pressed for a few seconds and also controls telephone calls.  The microphone works very well when used for calls and the music is paused automatically.Bluetooth pairing is a breeze with the device registering as S113BT.  No password is needed and the advanced Bluetooth 4.0 with aptX and enhanced data rate works every bit as well as the the included 3.5 mm audio cable.The rechargeable battery will provide power for at least six hours at reasonable volume when full, so this speaker is great for use on the go.  The zipper case is very nice, too, with mesh pockets inside to hold the audio and power cables.The soft-touch plastic case is very functional and fun to handle and it comes in a choice of several fun colors.  The rubbery surface does tend to attract lint and dust, but a damp cloth will easily clean it up.The only thing I don&#8217;t like about this speaker is that a small blue LED inside the front grill flashes every five seconds while in use.

If you do not place it correctly every few minutes it alerts you to let you know that you need to fix it. The unit is just slightly larger than the phone and about as thin as the phone so it does not take up a lot of space. The only trouble I had was keeping the back of my phone closed.

It is larger than other two-port devices I have had, and if you place a heavy device like a flashlight into it, it has difficulty staying plugged in.

The film is not as thick as other screen protectors that I have received. It does protect well and I did not have a problem with it curling up or peeling. It stays put and works as advertised. I tried scratching it but it was quite scratch resistant. The application was somewhat tricky. I couldn't figure it out right away with the enclosed instructions. I did eventually get it. However the side strips did not fit properly around my buttons. I didn't have a problem fitting a case on the phone with the protector in place.

They do stand up to use by the teenagers and they love the colors. I received this product for a fair and honest review.,5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51bFaytpdpL._SY300_.jpg

It's easily double the size of my other 4-port USB wall charger. On the positive side, this means there's more room between the USB ports, which get crowded on smaller chargers.I like that the USB ports are on the back side of the wall charger instead of the back or the side, making them easier to reach without unplugging from the outlet.  On the other hand, the prongs don't retract.  Retractable prongs are a must when traveling, to prevent holes rubbing holes into luggage and bags.  Many USB wall chargers come with retractable prongs.  Size and prongs make this USB wall charger more suitable for home use.How does it perform at home?  Very well.  There are four ports: two 2 amp ports and two 1 amp ports.  At times, I've had them all going at once, charging tablets, power banks, speakers, lamps -- no problem.  For added peace of mind, surge protection is built in.The Amzdeal USB wall charger is not my favorite wall charger because of the massive, bigger-than-wall-wart size.  It performs as advertised, though, and there are some advantages to being big.  If you need room between the ports, this is a viable option.This product was provided for review by Aukey.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31PG1kQkSGL._SY300_.jpg

I like this speaker, and so does everyone else.There's a blue mood light, which would be cool if we only didn't already have blue mood lights in the hot tub.

Our cabin was devoid of electricity, so I relied on this power bank.  Instructions note that the solar charging is just for emergencies, that it should not be left in the sun for prolonged periods of time.  I had to wonder what a consumer would expect buying a solar charging power bank if it weren't to be be left in the sun.  How long is too long?  So, I left it out to charge.  Seeing that the battery level was not moving up above one bar, I did what any normal person who doesn't read instructions would do and left it out all day, every day.  After a full day of bathing in the sun (sometimes shaded by trees but I tried to move it to full sun when I saw that), the power bank has enough juice to give my HTC One a 10% charge.I've had experience with larger solar chargers, so I didn't expect much more, though I did hope for it.  Even three and four panel fold-up chargers take a bit of time to fully charge a 5000 mAh power bank.  This power bank is the size of a large cell phone.  There just isn't enough surface area to catch the solar energy.  Instead, we can charge this power bank with a USB cable, which is what I do most of the time.  When it's fully charged, I can give my HTC One a 100% charge.This is a rugged power bank.  The ports are covered, and there's a carabiner for hanging off a backpack.  It's good for camping, but don't rely on the solar panel.

It's also an FM radio, and it has inputs for a TF card and flash drive and auxiliary cable.  The speaker speaks to us in a pleasant female voice with an Asian accent.

Alas, it does not display the time.Bluetooth was easy to set up with my iPhone 4S.  It always reconnects automatically.  The range is not the best of my Bluetooth devices but still very good.  I can go down a long hallway and still get reception.  Documentation says it can get up to 20 meters.  I'd say that's about right.Phone calls are poor.  I can hear the caller, but the voice is soft.  The caller can hear me, buy my voice is muddled.TF card and flash drive work well with this speaker.  The display will tell me what track I'm on but nothing else.  The only way to pick and choose music is to skip forward and back.The radio will scan all the stations until his has a list of live channels in the area.  After I do it once, I don't have to do it again.  Reception is very good.  I don't get a lot of static.One thing I would like to see is a larger power button.  We get a small one I have to look to find.  Other than that, this little speaker puts out a lot of sound.  While it may not have the richness of higher end systems, it can fill a room.

It has one head with three connectors: micro USB, 30-pin, and lightning. When I charge anything, lights run up the cable to the device, showing the flow of energy. When the charge is slower, the lights move more slowly. When the charge stops, the lights disappear. Love! Now, I know that my devices are charging without having to turn them on or looking for a tiny blink.This isn't a cable you want in your bedroom at night. It's quite bright when you see it in the dark, and there's no way to turn the lights off. In bright daylight, I have the opposite problem. I can't see the running lights for the life of me. If we want to see the lights, we have to use the cable indoors or at night.So far, I've used the cable to charge my iPhone 4S and my tablets and power banks. The only problem I foresee is the micro USB and lightning sides need a lot of clearance. If the case you are using doesn't have much clearance around the micro USB or lightening port, you may have to remove the case.I did try to use the cable for data.

I still had one power socket left available.  All went well.  My phone was fully charged at my destination.  I had plenty of power for the cam and GPS.The Rocketek car charger is large.  The tail end folds 90 to fit our needs, but I would prefer it somehow fold up to make the unit more compact for storage.Truth be told, I think cars should come with lots of extra USB ports and power sockets built in.  Until that happens, it's nice to have a car charger like this.This product was provided for review by Rocketek.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BlupJc31L._SY300_.jpg

Honestly, some I know at the outset.  They are horrible or they incredibly good.  When I get a gut reaction . . . ahhhhh . . . then love is in the air.Ahhh.  Oh, what a feeling.  These earphones are wonderful.  The music envelopes me.  It is so crystal clear, great sound separation and depth.  I feel like I'm swimming in a world of song.Love the earbud wings.  They keep the earphones in my ear from falling out and they position them perfectly.  I don't have to keep adjusting anything.  I've never that that sort of success with the over-ear variety or stabilizers.Bluetooth range is pretty good.  I can go down the hallway around a bend and still have a connection.  I get almost as far as I do with most of my devices.I can get voice commands on my phone and also last number redial through the cord controls.Phone calls are good.  I get a mild echo of my voice when I'm talking.  On the other end, the caller experiences a similar mild echo, but the conversation is unaffected as the voices are clear for all.  I can talk to my daughter without having to repeat myself or asking what she just said.The only problem I've had is the occasional crackle (like it's breaking up) when I'm streaming music.  It's very occasional and could easily be my cell phone signal breaking up.  I wouldn't hold it against the earphones.  They are the best I've had in a long time.

It is rated IPx4 waterproof.  What does that mean?  I means splash resistant.  Do not try to submerge this.This is a hanging speaker, which in the end is better than suction mount, because most suctions eventually fail.  You will need a place to hang this, though.The radio is a useful feature, since I don't always remember to have my phone nearby when I shower.  I can just turn on the radio.  It gets good reception and great sound, not a lot of static.  It skips to the stations that come in well.  I just can't tell what station I'm on.  It needs some sort of dial or display to let us know.  Once I got a channel I liked, I just left it there.Pairing with my iPhone was easy and it always reconnects automatically when I turn it on.  The Bluetooth has a great range, comparable to my other Bluetooth speakers.  I can place the phone two rooms away and still have a solid connection.Music via Bluetooth is great in my shower, and though I don't ever want to receive my calls there, I had my son call me just to see how calls come through.  I assume anyone using this in the shower would turn the water off first, so we did not try this in the shower with the water on.  Phone calls are softer than the music, so I turned the volume all the way up.  Conversation was easy.  I could hear him without problems.  We switched so I could listen to the caller's end and found that it was good from that angle, also.  There was no problem with the speaker cutting in and out like it sometimes happens on speakerphone.Siri works, also.  Hooray for that!  I'm finding him more useful by the day.Battery life is excellent.  I charged it once via USB using the proprietary cord (included, but don't lose that cord).  It's been a couple of weeks of use every morning and the battery is still going strong.It's a good speaker.  I like it.PROS:+ FM radio/Bluetooth speaker combined+ makes and receives phone calls (works with Siri!)+ splash resistant+ long battery life+ good reception, sound qualityCONS:- no way to tune to specific radio station (scan only)- proprietary charging cordThis product was provided for review by Abco Tech.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TW2dNSnTL._SY300_.jpg

It's tiny, lightweight, comfortable to wear. I can put it on either ear. It doesn't actually go into the canal but rather hangs on the ear, and we can wear it on either ear simply by removing the little ear hook and turning it around.Pairing with Bluetooth was quick and easy. It reconnects automatically with my iPhone 4S whenever I turn on the headset. Range is okay. I can go at least a room away from the phone and still have a connection.I've been using this for music while I walk my dog every day. I find it safer than using a headset for both ears. This way, I can leave one ear open. I am still half deaf to the world, but it's better than fully deaf. For only one ear, music sounds pretty good.I'm not able to call up Siri through the headset, but I can do it from my phone, of course. The only controls I really have are volume, mute, and answer/end calls. I can pause music, but I can't skip forward. The controls are easy to reach and understand, but I find myself accidentally disconnecting calls when I'm adjusting volume. That's easy to do. I have to be very careful when reaching for the controls or adjusting the headset not to push that power button.Calls are clear from the Bluetooth side. I can have a call without the other end asking me to repeat myself too many times and I can hear the callers just fine; but when I tested it with my daughter, I found clarity from the caller's end to be just good enough. I could hear her when she's wearing my Bluetooth headset. She was plenty loud and she didn't cut in and out, but there was not the crispness that make words easy to distinguish. They blended together enough to make me have to really focus on what she was saying. So, it works, but could be better.This is a good option for those who want to listen to music on one ear. Phone calls are okay. I use it more for music or when I'm put on a long hold.This product was provided for review by Smart Mobility.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lZph0UlkL._SY300_.jpg

It's a fingerprint magnet, and I find these types of surfaces tend to scratch easily.  The pouch keeps it clean and protects it from marring.There's also a little LED light onboard.  Sometimes, it's nice to have a flashlight.I like the small size (about the size of a small wallet) and the dual ports -- one of them is 2.1 amps, the other 1 amp, which I can use simultaneously.

Given the large size of some cell phones nowadays, I don't think it's for a lot of people.The mount comes with a metal plate that can either be inserted inside the case or mounted on the exterior of the phone or case.  It works better on the outside, of course.I prefer it on the inside of my case.  The outside of my case is textured and adhesive wouldn't hold anyway.  I really don't want it taped directly to my phone and have to go without a case.  So with the only option I find tolerable, my phone slips.  It slips when the mount is jostled.CLIP MOUNTThe mount for my TomTom fails us a lot, and my husband has been on me to change mounts.  I have gone through so many dashboard mounts.  Not a one would fit my TomTom.  The TomTom is thick, with a speaker on the back, and this clip mount is the first and only mount that would accommodate it.The clip will devices up to 4 inches wide and it can be rotated from landscape to portrait position.  It also can be tilted, but it sits higher on the dash than my TomTom's original mount does.Mounting and unmounting devices is quick and easy.OVERALL IMPRESSIONIf this device was merely a clip mount, I would give it five stars for being the only generic mount that has ever worked with my TomTom.  If this device was merely a magnetic mount, I would give it three stars (doesn't work for me, but would probably work if I met certain conditions - lightweight phone, metal plate mounted externally, etc.).  I like the versatility.  We can choose the mounting option that works for us.This product was provided for review by Aerb.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mPCnQpTsL._SY300_.jpg

He figured out I couldn't hear myself talk because I was talking so loudly.Pairing is quick and easy.  Reconnection is automatic.  Range is as good as my other good Bluetooth devices.Phone calls come in loud and clear, but I do hear my own voice echo a little or a lot, depending on the volume I set on the phone.  I turned it all the way down, which didn't affect the call volume on the other end.  On my end, that made the echo lessen to a tolerable level and the caller's voice remains loud enough to have a conversation.The music quality is good enough for me to enjoy.  I like the controls, which are easy to reach and use by feel.  It's nice to have volume and forward/repeat buttons be different buttons.  When they are the same, I can't figure out if I need to short press or long press to adjust volume.  I always get it wrong.Aesthetics: I'm not crazy about the external part of the headband.  The flat, wide band is begging for curves.  Lots of Bluetooth headphones look like this.  Perhaps it's the loud color in combination that makes it stand out, but the underside of the band makes up for it with a smooth, creamy texture that I can almost taste through my fingers.It's a nice set of headphones.This product was provided for review by BlueMall.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41P2QAec3tL._SY300_.jpg

They sent it anyway.  Gutsy move.  I thought, here's a company that believes in its product.  So, I've been using it on my daily walks.I was a little self-conscious, at first, but now I don't feel as ridiculous as I imagined.  The phone attaches via the charging port, but it's secure.  I haven't had any accidental releases that I imagined would happen.  In fact, sometimes I forget it's not a charging cord and just try to yank it out.  It doesn't come off unless I simultaneously squeeze the release buttons on the side.The attached ear buds are metal, which means I can wipe them off with alcohol.  They don't slip out, but I get a better fit with other types of ear buds.  These don't block ambient noise, if I keep the volume down.  I like that, since I'm walking and I want to hear the car coming before it hits me.The ear buds connect via auxiliary port, so I don't have to bother with Bluetooth.  I get crisp and clear music in stereo with my iPhone 4S.  It lacks a little in warmth but it's not bad at all.  The average listener would not find have any issues with it.Although I'm still not a fan of wearing my phone on a lanyard, I like the iHangy more than I thought I would.  It allows me quick access to the phone and a great thing to have when I don't have pockets.  I wouldn't recommend it for the gym or jogging, since the phone swings around and is likely to be bumped or get in the way.  It's best used for walking.If you want to wear your phone, this works quite well.  The mount is secure and the sound quality good.  It's a convenient way to keep a phone handy without a wallet.This product was provided for review by Ontrion.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vNvHNSM0L._SY300_.jpg

There is no pouch, but I really don&#8217;t need one for this style.How much power is 2200 mAh?  It can give my iPhone 4S one full charge.  I&#8217;ve used it to power my dash cam over and over and over.  It&#8217;s received heavy usage and is still going strong.The only drawback to this power bank is the LED light.  It&#8217;s flashing blue when it&#8217;s charging a device.  It&#8217;s solid red when it&#8217;s being charged.  There is no indicator for how much power is remaining until it&#8217;s fully drained, in which case the indicator won&#8217;t turn on.I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this power bank for a tablet, but it&#8217;s ideal for cell phones.This product was provided for review by Arctic.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31sXfHebXwL._SY300_.jpg

The phones connect to the receiver via Bluetooth.  It helps keep our hands free for driving.  This is my second corded Bluetooth receiver and here's what I thought.Sound from this Bluetooth music receiver is good.  Music comes out of my car's speaker system just like it would from my satellite radio.  Calls are clear from my end, just like it was coming from my iPhone itself, although I do have to turn the volume up to the max to achieve that.  From the caller's end, it's definitely clear that I'm on a Bluetooth device of some sort and not a phone.  It has that speakerphone quality to it.Pairing and operation is not too difficult.  I can answer and end calls, pause and play music, skip tracks by pressing the controls on the receiver by touch.  It's very intuitive.  I can't seem to get Siri or make calls through the controls, though.The receiver comes with a connector, which would be so convenient if my Honda Odyssey's audio jack was a little higher.  As it is, I have to reach down low to press the buttons.  So, I have to connect it to an audio cable (included).  Here's the problem: there's no way to mount this receiver when it's connected to a cable.  I have to rest it on the tray next to me - not an ideal solution.  My other Bluetooth receiver mounts to the car's dash - much better.The sound quality is good, but without the ability to make calls or get Siri and with no mounting option when using a cable, I am less than ecstatic. 3  stars.This product was provided for review by Abco Tech.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41u9rIHv3eL._SY300_.jpg

Listen to music, pick up like a phone.  That's handy, much better than turning my Bluetooth speaker into a speakerphone.PHONE CALLSWhen I get calls on my HTC One, the Bolse speaker doesn't ring.  The cell phone does.  This is the only Bluetooth speaker I own that does that.  On all the other speakers, the ring comes through on the speaker.Then, there's the problem with the calls.  I can't figure out why some calls come through, some get rejected, and some go to voicemail.  I read the instructions, I tried to replicate the successful calls, but it seems somewhat random the results I get.  It is frustrating and not acceptable at all considering the selling point of this device.I can call out using the last number redial feature of the handset or just dialing out on my phone.  I can get a Google Voice search for different things on Google through the handset, but it doesn't call up a phone number for me or anything.When I get a connection, phone calls are clear from both ends.  There is a slight echo on my end lately that was not there the first time I used it.  For the most part, it's good enough.  Just remember to hang up using the multi-function button.MUSICThere is a lack of good volume for the speaker.  It's no louder than my cell phone.  In fact, I measured the volume for the cell phone at 76.6 dB at 1 foot away.  The speaker gives me 75.9 dB at 1 foot away.  I have the HTC One Harman Kardon edition, and that speaker beats the Bolse speaker in fullness and clarity any day.BLUETOOTHPairing is easy, and reconnection is automatic.  Range is on the upper end of excellent.  I can get a signal on par with most of my better Bluetooth devices.  In this area, the Q9 shines.OVERALL IMPRESSIONI'm disappointed, especially with the phone function.  This is my second unit.

The device itself is very compact, measuring only about 4 inches wide and 2.25 inches deep. It has five USB ports on the front. Three are labeled as &#8220;universal&#8221; ports, and provide a 1A output; two are labeled as &#8220;super charger&#8221; ports and provide a max of 2.1A. According to the specs, the super charger ports will adjust their output based on the demand of whatever is plugged in. The total output across all five ports is 7.2A/36 watts.It has an on/off switch on the back, which is a feature I really like and is not often found in chargers. I don&#8217;t like to leave the charger on overnight, and the switch allows me to turn it off without having to unplug the devices. There&#8217;s a small LED indicator on the top that shows when it is powered on. It&#8217;s easily visible, but is not lighthouse beacon bright.It has an in-line transformer that is pretty large but, since it&#8217;s not at the end of the cord, it doesn't block the wall outlet.

All the ports are well anchored; the power cord is sturdy; and the ports are well-labeled with white on black lettering. The only thing it lacks that I would have liked is non-skid feet on the base of the unit. The unit is small and light enough that it&#8217;s not a major omission, but it would have been a nice feature to have.Other than the lack of non-skid feet, zero complaints.

I&#8217;m especially fond of the way they put bumpers on both the top and the bottom, so you can flip it over and still have non-skid feet on the bottom.It has a novel design feature in that there&#8217;s a large slot through the speaker through which there&#8217;s a lanyard (which is included). Great feature for ease of carrying this around.The sound quality is pretty good. It&#8217;s a bit muted sounding, but the bass response is excellent &#8211; better than expected given the small size.The controls are all on the same end, and consist of an on/off button, a micro USB input for charging, and a 3.5mm input jack for direct connects.

The bluetooth range is very good, with zero dropouts at about 25 feet. As expected, the direct connect option worked perfectly.The only negative is that it lacks volume control. But that also eliminates a set of buttons on the speaker, and thus eliminates a potential point of water entry.I think this is an excellent value for the price point.

This powerbank tries to move past the &#8220;just for recharging&#8221; use by incorporating a voice recorder. While the idea is interesting, the actual execution needs to go back to the drawing board.On the plus side, the powerbank itself is quite nice. It has a sturdy metal case, a large on/off button, and a compact shape that&#8217;s easy to carry (about 3.5 inches long, 1.5 inches wide and 1 inch thick). The rounded edges make it easy to hold. There&#8217;s a single USB output port on the top next to a large, and very bright LED flashlight. While the capacity is somewhat small (4000mAh) it&#8217;s enough to handle a full phone recharge while remaining small enough so that you don&#8217;t mind carrying it along. It has the customary LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; to show the power level left.The voice recording is a mess, however. The instructions on how to use it are almost indecipherable. I finally got it working through trial and error. The audio is stored on a micro SD card (which is included) that you insert in the base of the powerbank. There&#8217;s a cover you&#8217;re supposed to then stick over it, but there&#8217;s no cutout for the SD card &#8211; the only cutout is for the adjacent micro USB port that is used to recharge the powerbank. So, once you stick on the adhesive cover, you&#8217;re prevented from removing (at least easily removing) the SD card.There is no clear indication as to when the recorder is recording and when it is not. The overall recording user interface is very poor.While the powerbank can record, it cannot play back. You need to hook the powerbank to a PC and download the file to play it. Getting it connected to a PC to access the files proved impossible, so I ended up taking the SD card out and reading it off a card reader (glad I didn't glue on the cover!). The audio quality is not bad. Not great, but usable.I can see having audio recording being a bonus if you want to record something such as a lecture and don&#8217;t want to carry along a recorder. But, given the low cost and size of digital recorders these days (plus the fact that some phones can do that as well) having a record-only feature in a powerbank does not provide much value.Five stars for the powerbank features; zero stars for the audio; overall score of 2.5 stars rounded down to 2 given the price point of this item for a 4000mAh capacity.[Sample provided for review]",2.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J4PjL96GL._SY300_.jpg

It&#8217;s very lightweight and I didn't see how it could actually hold a phone in place. Surprisingly, it really does work well!There are two micro suction pads. One is on the base, which holds the stand in place on a desk (or any other flat surface); the other pad is on the holding arm. It comes with a plastic protector film on both pads which you need to peel off before use. Be careful peeling it off &#8211; it&#8217;s stuck on firmly and you don&#8217;t want to damage the suction pad.It holds surprisingly tight. You have to push the base pretty firmly to get it to move.

So, when testing it out to see how much force it will resist, don&#8217;t have your phone on it or the phone will go flying (learned that the hard way).The top pad can be used as-is to hold a phone or other small device.. There&#8217;s zero residue left on the phone when you remove it from the pad.The build quality is decent. It&#8217;s all plastic, but it&#8217;s nicely formed. Unfortunately, it has a glossy finish which looks great when clean, but is a huge fingerprint magnet.It also includes a small cradle with hooks at the base to hold items you don&#8217;t want to stick directly to the pad. You stick the cradle on the pad, and then put your device in the cradle. The hooks will hold a device up to  inch wide very well, and can be used for thicker devices if you don&#8217;t mind that the device won&#8217;t seat well in the cradle.The pads do get gummed up with dust and dirt and loose their grip power. They have to be cleaned regularly (the manufacturer suggests using adhesive tape to pull off the accumulated gunk). That&#8217;s something to keep in mind &#8211; without cleaning, it won&#8217;t work well.The holding power is 100% steady for lightweight items. I had zero failures when holding items as heavy as 6 ounces. Heavier items can be held as well &#8211; I was able to get this to hold items as heavy as one pound, but the holding power is not maintained, and the object falls off after a while. The amount it can hold is also based on where the center of gravity is. For example, a short piece of pipe weighing 16 ounces stayed put for hours; a tall sheet of plastic weighing half as much fell off after a few minutes.In practical terms, this will hold pretty much any phone very well. I&#8217;d also trust it to hold a 5 inch tablet provided that I used care when touching the screen while the tablet was on the mount. I would not trust it with a larger tablet not so much due to the weight, but the fact that the center of gravity is too high for it to be stable. Again, everything is with the caveat that the holding surfaces are clean.Although it&#8217;s not cheap, it&#8217;s a novel approach to holding a phone or small tablet on your desk for ease of use and for watching video. Well worth considering.[Sample provide for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41fRH2BC0SL._SX300_.jpg

It is, however, rather bulky &#8211; not a good choice if you have a small car with a cramped cabin. It&#8217;s not huge (measures about 3.5 inches ling and 2.25 inches wide) but it&#8217;s much more bulky than the typical one or two port car charger.The thickness also contributes to its bulk &#8211; it&#8217;s about 1.25 inches thick since it includes 2 power ports (e.g., cigarette lighter ports) on the side. I can&#8217;t see a real reason for that unless you want to use this to power something else that needs a power port, such as an old-style GPS. Since most devices these days get powered with a USB cable, having two power ports on the side just seems to add bulk rather than value.But you do get an advantage for the large size &#8211; capacity. This has four USB output ports on the top. Two are rated for 3A output; the other 2 are not rated but I would imagine they are 2.1A or so since they are labeled for use with an iPhone/iPad.The power cord is stout and well-attached. The plug that goes into the car&#8217;s power port is spring loaded and fits well without any rattle.If you have the room, this is a very versatile in-car charger that covers all the bases.[Sample provided for review]",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41S9f5NwxFL._SX300_.jpg

There are two products listed under this tab -- this is for the small blue speaker.&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;This speaker won&#8217;t wow you with superlative sound quality, but the sound that came out of it given how tiny it is certainly was impressive to me. It&#8217;s a great choice for when you want something more capable than the speaker that&#8217;s built into a phone or tablet, but don&#8217;t want to deal with having to carry around a &#8220;real&#8221; external speaker.I was not expecting this to be so small. It measures about 1.75 in diameter and is just under 2 inches long. Very cute design &#8211; looks sort of like a jet engine. The build quality feels very solid. It has a rubberized external shell that is very non-slip. The buttons are small, but give have an audible and tactile click to them so you know it&#8217;s been pressed. It has aPairing was simple and quick. It has a decent range &#8211; I was able to use it a good 15 feet from my tablet without any dropouts.Compared with a conventional portable bluetooth speaker the sound quality of this is on the tinny side (no surprise there given the speaker size). But, the bass is impressive &#8211; not what I would call &#8220;room shaking&#8221; but certainly far better than expected, and on a par with some larger speakers I&#8217;ve used. Again, with the caveat of its size, the sound quality is quite good.The size makes it perfect for a phone. You can get much better sound when streaming music than a phone puts out, but don&#8217;t have to carry anything of any appreciable size. This literally would fit on a keychain. It includes a plastic lanyard for ease of carrying and a cable for charging the internal battery (micro USB cable).Excellent choice if you&#8217;re looking for a very small, very portable speaker that sounds pretty good. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yMZFO1BdL._SY300_.jpg

This is not the case with the Energen. It fits very well on the iPhone &#8211; secure, tight fit but without any port access problems. While the case does make the phone fatter (as expected) it still looks pretty sleek. It also has a kickstand feature that allows the phone to be propped up for viewing, which is a helpful addition.The battery gives a capacity of 2400mAh which the manufacturer claims will double the battery life. That&#8217;s pretty accurate. I like that it has a &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; charge indicator (4 LED lights) that give a quick read on how much power is left.I find it to be a great alternative to using an external powerbank since the case is a lot easier to take along and doesn&#8217;t add much bulk to the phone.

It has its limitations, however &#8211; recharging only by solar is very slow and can take several hours to build up a decent charge level. But if you don&#8217;t have access to power, such as while camping or in an emergency situation, any ability to recharge can be hugely helpful.The overall build quality seems very good. It has a good heft to it, and it is encased in a water resistant frame that is also shock resistant. The input and output ports are covered with rubber flaps to keep out dust and moisture. I really like that the flaps are attached to the body to prevent me from losing them.The overall size is pretty compact. It&#8217;s just shy of 3 inches wide and about 5.5 inches long. It&#8217;s very thin (about  inch thick) making it pretty convenient to take along in a backpack or even a large pocket. It comes with a clip ring so you can hang it on a strap on a backpack.The output ports (2 of them) are located on the top on either side, and provide a 1A output. There&#8217;s also a micro USB input port for conventional recharging. It has a 4 LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; to show the power level remaining.No complaints at all regarding performance. It recharged my phone and mp3 player without a problem, and still had about 50% capacity remaining. The 5000mAh capacity means this is best for small devices but, in a pinch, you can also use it for a larger device, such as a tablet, albeit the charge speed will be slow and you probably won't be able to fully recharge the device before the powerbank is empty.While it&#8217;s priced higher than a conventional powerbank of the same size, the solar recharge option makes this a better choice if you&#8217;re looking for something that can be carried along for camping or hiking, and still maintain the ability to recharge it even when there&#8217;s no power.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51eNAMNGg1L._SY300_.jpg

While they are not perfect, they are well worth considering if you&#8217;re looking for an affordable set of bluetooth headphones with some extra features.Comfort &#8211; I&#8217;d rate the comfort as good. The earpads are soft and cushy, and easily mold themselves to my ears. The headband is well padded for top-of-the-head comfort (not a small issue for those of use who are sparse of hair). The adjustments work well to secure the set to stay put even when moving around.On the downside, the earpads are just a bit too small for optimal comfort. They are on-ear pads, so a more elongated shape, rather than the round shape, would have been better for my needs. Also, the earpads don&#8217;t breath very well leading to &#8220;hot ear&#8221; after these are worn for a while.Build quality &#8211; good, especially considering the price. Everything feels pretty solid and secure, but the set is still very lightweight. They also look very nice - again, nicer than you would expect for the price.Bluetooth &#8211; zero problems pairing this with a variety of devices. The bluetooth range is very good, with no dropouts at 20 or so feet.Sound quality &#8211; impressive for the price. These are not audiophile-level earphones, but deliver a good sound with a decent amount of bass. The midrange is a bit muddy, but not so much to be annoying. The volume limit is a bit light as well.Dual use &#8211; unlike most bluetooth headphones, these can be hardwired using a 3.5mm audio cable. That&#8217;s a great feature since not every deice has bluetooth or for the times when you don&#8217;t want to go through the pairing process.There&#8217;s a big catch, however. The controls (both buttons and swipe controls, as described in the next section) don&#8217;t work when you&#8217;re hardwired. You have to use the tablet (or whatever this is attached to) for volume control and other operations.Touch control &#8211; in addition to the usual buttons for volume, skip, etc., you can touch and swipe the left earcup for control. Some work great &#8211; pause is a single tap and that works 100% of the time. Volume is more hit and miss. Sometimes it recognizes a swipe; other times not. It is also a one swipe = 1 volume increment rather than a sliding scale.All in all, it&#8217;s a good set of earphones that I would certainly recommend. It has its limitations in terms of sound quality and touch control operations, but it offers a good value for the price point.[Sample provided for review]",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31zZDFcOinL._SY300_.jpg

The frame is looks and feels like it is made of aluminium (but I believe it is plastic) with cut outs along the sides to add visual interest. The top is slanted with a black metal grill. It&#8217;s a lot more interesting looking than the usual utilitarian design for a speaker.The control buttons are on the base and, while the buttons are small, are clearly marked as to function with white-on-black lettering. The buttons have a slight click to them so you get tactile feedback that it has been pressed. The ports (a 3.5mm input port for a direct connect and a micro USB port for recharging) are also on the front for easy access.  It measures 3 inches wide at the base, and is 2.75 inches high (at the highest point).The base has a non-slip pad. I initially thought the pad was just so-so, but then I realized it comes packed with a plastic sheet over the pad which you need to peel off. With the plastic off, it provides excellent non-slip performance even when jarred.Pairing was quick and easy, as was using the direct connect method. Bluetooth range was great, with a solid connection at 20 or so feet. The internal battery is rated at 500mAh which is pretty decent for a speaker this size.The sound quality is excellent in terms of clarity. The mid and upper ranges come through very nicely, making this great for dialog or podcasts. The bass is there, but it&#8217;s not all that pronounced. If you like a strong, booming bass in your sound, this is probably not a good choice. However, if you prize clarity with enough bass to round things out well, this probably won&#8217;t disappoint.The only notable negative is the user guide. Although this comes very nicely packaged to make it look upscale, the user guide is very brief, not that helpful, and poorly translated. It&#8217;s not an issue that warrants a down rating overall (since many of the features are self-explanatory if you've used this type of speaker before) but it sticks out as being at odds with the attention paid to product styling and packaging.It&#8217;s a little more expensive than typical portable bluetooth speakers, but the build quality, looks, and features (large battery plus mic for phone use) make it a decent value. It&#8217;s a great desktop speaker especially if you like to listen to podcasts.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41evvf%2B4hQL._SY300_.jpg

The build quality is excellent &#8211; it looks and feels much better than I expected it would given the price point. It feels very solid to the point where it&#8217;s hard to tell if the case is plastic or metal. The seams are tight and the edges are all nicely rounded. All the control buttons have a good feel to them (although they could be better marked, as noted later in the review).The grill is gray which blends well with the overall black-on-black look. It has a nice overall shape &#8211; a curved top and a curved front which gives it a very elegant look. The only thing that I feel detracts from the overall look is that the top has a gloss finish. Looks great when it&#8217;s shiny; but it is a major fingerprint magnet.It has two large non-slip grippers on the base that are very effective in keeping the speaker planted on a desk. The overall size is pretty compact &#8211; it&#8217;s about 5 inches long, 2.5 inches wide at the widest point (the middle) and stands about 2 and 3/8 inches tall.It has the usual bluetooth connectivity plus the ability to use a 3.5mm cord to direct connect it to a tablet. Both methods worked just fine &#8211; pairing was quick, and using the cord to connect was simple. The bluetooth range was very good with no dropouts at 20+ feet. I&#8217;m especially pleased with the bluetooth pairing sound &#8211; rather than a grating beep (or, worse yet, spoken prompts) this has a very nice (and quiet) chime.The sound quality was quite good. It&#8217;s not a &#8220;big&#8221; sound, but it performs admirably given the size. As with the build quality, it sounds far better than you would expect given the price. It does get somewhat harsh at loud volumes, but at normal listening levels it puts out a fairly clear sound with a decent amount of bass.It also offers phone functionality with a built-in mic. I didn&#8217;t test that, so I can&#8217;t give feedback on its quality.It comes with a very nicely made carry pouch and a manual that actually is readable and helpful.Complaints are few. As noted previously, I&#8217;m not a fan of the glossy top. I also wish the side controls for volume were better marked. They work fine, but it&#8217;s almost impossible to see which side of the rocker switch to press. Not a huge deal, but I prefer clear markings even if it detracts a little from the overall black-on-black color scheme.There&#8217;s a lot of bluetooth mini speakers out there, but this stands out with solid build quality, sound and looks. I&#8217;m happy with it, and would recommend it.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Dw7FQzAxL._SY300_.jpg

Instead of looking like a wart on the side of the phone (as some battery cases can look) this has a very sculpted look to it that blends in very well with the iPhone.The case has a rubberized-like feel to it that is very fingerprint resistant. The fit is excellent &#8211; tight enough to avoid any slippage but not so tight that you need the jaws of life to get it off the phone. It&#8217;s a two-part design (top and bottom halves) which makes it very simple to put it on the phone. The access ports are perfectly aligned and have smooth, rounded edges.The capacity is 2300mAh which, considering the slim form factor, it pretty impressive. I very much like that there&#8217;s a 4 LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; on the bottom corner which shows the battery level left in the powerbank. It&#8217;s easily visible but not glaring.I also like that you can recharge both the case and the phone with a single cable.

However, they were rather disappointing on a number of levels.The best feature about them is the comfort. They fit well, are lightweight, and the cord is easily managed even when moving around (such as on exercise equipment at the gym). You know they are there, but I could wear them for an hour or so without any ear fatigue or irritation. The &#34;ear wings&#34; that hold them in place are fussy to keep attached, however.The sound quality is decent but not anything out of the ordinary. I have bluetooth buds that are less than a quarter of the price of these that put out pretty much the same sound quality. These sound a bit tinny with little depth, and the bass is muddy. Nothing special or even a little outstanding about the sound quality. The volume range is limited compared with other earbuds &#8211; even at the max volume it did not put out the volume I was looking for.While they paired up with my tablets easily, they disconnected several times each time I used them. This may be due to the fact that I was using them at the gym, which has a lot of other people using bluetooth systems plus a lot of machinery. However, I nearly always use bluetooth headphones (or bluetooth-connected speakers of some sort) there, and this is the first time that has happened, so I am attributing the problem to the Jabra equipment.Given the problems with connection, the only average sound quality and limited volume, the best I can offer these is a below average rating. There are better choices available at this price point and, if you&#8217;re willing to live with something that&#8217;s less stylish, you can get the equal sound quality and better/more stable connectivity for a lot less money.

They did revise it, and they deserve kudos for doing that.  While I still don't think this is a truly compelling, must-have item, I'll change my rating from 3 to 4 stars since the product does what it should, and could be handy for people who don't remember to bring along a charging cable. The build quality keeps it at a 4 star, rather than 5 star rating.ORIGINAL REVIEW:The product name and description is a bit misleading - this is just a USB cable (either a USB-to-micro USB or USB-to-Lightning version) that folds up into a plastic holder that you can hang on a keychain.I have the micro USB version.The build quality is OK. To unfold it, it's best to unlatch the micro USB end first, then the USB end. Do the opposite when refolding it into the case. Otherwise it can be a struggle to get the ends out of the holder.It works fine - no difference than using any other cable. It is very short - the total length of the cable is about 4 inches.The advantage is that since it is so compact and comes in a plastic holder, you can easily keep this with you with your keys (or hang it onto your backpack, etc.). But, since many powerbanks come with attached cords these days, I can't recall not having access to a cable when I needed it when not at home. At home I have dozens of cables so having one on my keychain is not much of an advantage.Given the price this is an average value. It would be a more compelling purchase if it did more than just serve as a cable, or if the build quality was more robust.[Sample provided for review]",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KqzwU7DcL._SX300_.jpg

First the pluses:&#62;&#62; The overall build quality is good. It&#8217;s all plastic, but it feels pretty substantial. The ball and socket joint moves smoothly and allows for a good adjustment range.&#62;&#62;  The suction cup worked well. As with any suction cup, you need to have a clean, smooth surface for best results. Wetting the base of the cup with a little water also helps it maintain a good hold. I didn&#8217;t have any problems with it staying stuck even when going over bumps. Same with touching the screen, even with a decent amount of force.&#62;&#62; The arms have padding that help it grip the phone plus avoid scratching the case. Grip strength is good. You can rotate the position from portrait to landscape.But the minuses are pretty significant:&#62;&#62; Adjusting the arms requires you to push in the locking buttons which moves the arm through three stop points. The buttons are small and hard to push. This is not a mount for those with limited hand strength or arthritis. And, even if you have good hand strength, you end up pinching your finger when you push the buttons and pull up.&#62;&#62; There are only three pre-set stop points for the arm. When I put in my phone (Samsung Galaxy) without its case I was able to find a pre-set the was perfect. However, when I had the phone in the case, one pre-set was a little too tight; the next one was too loose. The pre-set notches don&#8217;t give you the ability to fine-tune the grip distance.&#62;&#62; The top grip is spring loaded, but the spring is so firm that when you apply pressure to release it, the arm skips out of the adjustment notch.While it has some merits, a ratchet-type arm adjustment would have been a better design. The three stop adjustment design is limiting and hard to use. It&#8217;s workable, but I can&#8217;t rate it better than average. Three stars.[Sample provided for review]",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ouhmjei5L._SY300_.jpg

It&#8217;s a three outlet surge protector that plugs directly into the wall, plus it has two USB ports for plugging in anything that charges from a USB cable. That combo has been done before, but this also includes two fold-out holders for phones (or other small devices). The holders extend sort of like wings from the side, and avoid having to put the phone on the floor while it&#8217;s charging. Nice idea!The build quality is pretty good. It&#8217;s all plastic, but feels pretty sturdy. On the back of the unit there&#8217;s a 3-prong post that plugs into the top outlet of a dual wall outlet, plus a plastic stability post that plugs into the bottom outlet. It also has a screw that threads into the center outlet cover screw to hold it firmly in place.I found it fits best in terms of looking flush to the wall if I removed the wall outlet cover.The downside is that it covers a dual wall outlet but only provides three surge-protected outlets, so you only really realize a gain of one outlet. The outlets are close together and don&#8217;t allow you to plug in more than two devices if they have a &#8220;wall wort&#8221; on the end. A better design would have been to space the outlets out more.The plastic &#8220;wings&#8221; allow it to hold a device that&#8217;s about three inches wide. It is a bit constrained in terms of depth &#8211; the bottom portion of the holder is only about 3/4 inch wide. Items thicker than 3/4 inch can be held, but they won&#8217;t be very secure. It&#8217;s best used for devices such as phones, iPods, or even small point and shoot cameras. The wings are too small to deal with any type of tablet. The USB outlets are rated at a total of 2.1ANice idea that, with the exception of the outlet spacing, is well-executed.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41I5vFTrb5L._SY300_.jpg

This charger stands out by having the most compact footprint of any other Qi charger I&#8217;ve tried.I was really surprised at how small it is. It measures about 2.5 inches in diameter and is about 2 inches tall. It takes up very little counter space, which is a major plus since I leave my Q1 charger plugged in all the time on my kitchen counter, and pop my phone on it when I get home.The top has a non-skid coating on the charge surface so it holds the phone without any sliding. It also has a non-slip coating on the base which is excellent &#8211; it does not budge a bit even if it&#8217;s pushed with some force.The top can also be rotated so that you can choose between having the charge surface be horizontal or at an angle. I&#8217;m using this for phone charging so I keep it in horizontal mode but, if I were to use this for a tablet, the angled mode would be helpful. The angled mode would also be useful if you wanted to use the phone while it is being charged.It comes with a USB cable and a plug for the outlet. The plug is a bit on the large side (about 1.75 inches long and 1.5 inches wide) but it&#8217;s thin enough so that it does not block any other outlets when plugged into the wall.There&#8217;s an indicator light that shows power on and whether it is charging. The light is easily seen but not blinding.The build quality seems pretty good. The only quibbles I have is that the rotation (switching it from horizontal to angled mode) is sort of balky, and the USB port is not anchored as good as it could be.Performance (in terms of charge time) seems to be on a par with other Qi chargers. It's a slower charge than direct-connecting the phone to the wall, and it puts out some heat while charging. Again, those issues are found in any Qi charger.If you&#8217;re looking for a small Qi charger this is well worth considering. The build quality issues knock it down to 4.5 stars, but I&#8217;ll round up since the size is so convenient and the non-slip coating works so well.NOTE: Keep in mind that your phone (or tablet) must be Qi capable in order to use this charger. It will ONLY work with Qi-capable devices.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41kl6FvIdYL._SY300_.jpg

I like the compact, square shape &#8211; very easy to take along on the road without feeling weighed down. It&#8217;s only about 4 inches tall and weighs only 2.4 ounces, so it&#8217;s easy to toss in a bag without a problem.The case is all plastic but seems well put together, with tight seams. The input and output ports are well-anchored. It also has a lanyard of sorts (a small cord with a key ring at the end) which can aid in keeping this attached to something in a bag. But, if you don&#8217;t like it, it can be easily snipped off.This offers only the basic functions. There&#8217;s no power level indicator &#8211; just one USB output port (1A) and one micro USB input port. Both are located at the top end. There&#8217;s an indicator light to show it is charging a device. The light goes out when the device is charged or the powerbank is empty. There&#8217;s also an indicator that comes on when you plug the powerbank in to charge it, and it also goes out when the powerbank is full.Given the small capacity (2600mAh) this is strictly for low-powered devices, such as mp3 players, phones, etc. It&#8217;s not at all suitable for a tablet. Even with small devices, 2600mAh doesn't go far &#8211; basically one full recharge and the powerbank will be empty.But, when you&#8217;re low on power something like this can be very handy. The small size makes it easy to take along so you&#8217;ll have it when needed.

That&#8217;s an important feature since the stitching is in a contrasting color and is very visible as a design feature.The leather is buttery soft with fine grain. The one I have is perfectly uniform in color, with zero leather defects. The color is a rich medium brown that looks great.The phone holder is plastic and grips the iPhone tightly. I shook it pretty hard (over a bed in case of case failure) but the phone stayed put. The cutouts are placed perfectly and have smooth edges.The inside is covered in a suede-type material that&#8217;s soft and feels very nice. The flap opposite the phone has two pouches to hold a drivers license, credit cards, etc. There&#8217;s also a full-length cutout to hold paper money.The case if held together with a flap that has a magnet. The magnet strength is adequate for holding the strap tight, but still makes it easy to open.Try as I can, I can&#8217;t come up with a single negative.

The sound quality in particular is impressive given the price point - very clear reception and decent performance for voice pickup. Zero problems with bluetooth pairing.The controls are very simple - the call answer/end button is part of the case, so there's no searching for it. Just press the case near the top to engage the button. It has a soft positive click to it. The volume up and down buttons are on the sides and are pretty thin. But, they are elongated rocker style buttons which helps to find them by touch.It charges via a USB cable (included). The manufacturer claims a 4 hour talk time, which is pretty accurate based on my use. There's no flap covering the micro USB input port. Not an issue for me (since I always loose those flaps anyway), but I wanted to note it in case it's important for others.Where it falls short a bit is comfort. The earpiece has a rubber cover, but essentially no padding. It's good at staying put in my ear, but not so good when it comes to long-term comfort. Definitely get some ear fatigue with this. The ear loop is flexible and pretty soft, but again, no padding. It does cause some outer ear chafing after a while.But given the price point, I think these are not significant enough to warrant a poor rating. Granted, a higher priced headset will be far more comfortable to wear for long periods of time than this, but I found it to be an excellent budget headset at the current price (about $12).4.5 stars rounded up to 5 since the voice and audio quality is better than expected given the budget price. It's a great choice if you're looking for a headset for short drives. If, however, you're going to be using it for hours at a time, I'd suggest something with more attention to comfort (which will be priced much higher than this).[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41lZph0UlkL._SY300_.jpg

Rather than tying up my USB hub on my PC, this plugs directly into a wall outlet and provides three USB ports for charging.I have the three port version. There are two ports on the top of the unit. One is rated at 2A, the other is 1A. There&#8217;s a third 1A port on the front face. There&#8217;s also an on/off switch on the top of the unit so I don&#8217;t need to have to unplug it from the wall to turn off the ports.The build quality feels very solid. All the ports are well attached, and the power cord is nice and stout. The cord is permanently attached to the dock, and is well anchored.The dock is roughly 3 inches wide and 3.5 inches deep. It has a very slim profile so it&#8217;s easy to find space for it on my desk under my monitor.Performance has been fine. No problems at all using all three ports at the same time (charged a tablet, a phone and an mp3 player). The ports are spaced far enough apart that I didn't have any problems getting all the cords in and out.Zero complaints![Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xt8VtlQTL._SX300_.jpg

It comes with both options. The magnet option is installed but to switch to the clip option all you need to do is remove the articulating head and replace it with the supplied clip.I like the clip option better than the magnet. It's not as sleek looking, but it allows me to use the mount for either a phone or a GPS. The max width that the clip will hold is roughly 4 inches. While the clip is plastic, the spring is very strong, and the clip jaws have padding to avoid scratching whatever it is holding. It pivots so you can switch between portrait and landscape mode.The magnet option works well too. The magnet held my phone firmly over bumps. It comes with a small piece of metal (roughly 2 by 2 inches) with an adhesive backing if your phone case does not have a magnetic attachment capability.The suction cup has a good amount of grip provided it's placed on a clean, smooth surface. Wetting the cup before application helps ensure a tight grip.The build quality is decent. It's not a heavy-duty mount (all plastic) but it seems sturdy enough to stand up to typical use.The only weak spot I see is the threading on the ball and socket joint. This has to be removed when you switch between the magnet and jaw option. The threading is plastic (as is the entire mount) and it's very easy to cross thread it. This is only an issue when you switch between mount options, so I won&#8217;t detract from the rating for it.It's not the most elegant looking mount I've seen, but it gets the job done and I really like the option of using either a magnetic or a standard jaw mount.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41mPCnQpTsL._SY300_.jpg

While those have the benefit of small size and being fully self-contained, they totally take over the outlet! I can sort of live with that in the kitchen since the outlets are above the counter, but my office outlets are near the floor, making it a mess of cables and devices when using the charger.This design uses a cord to plug into the outlet so I can keep the charger on my desk and not have to deal with a mass of cords and devices on the floor. The case is nicely styled with rounded edges. I have the white version, and it looks nice on my desk - blends right in without shouting &#34;I'm a charger!&#34;.It measures about 4.25 inches wide at the widest point and is about 3.75 inches deep. The power cord plug into the back. The end that plugs into the outlet is just a regular plug without any type of wall wart. That's a huge plus for me since my power strips don't have room for another block-sized transformer.The 4 USB ports are on the front. Two are 2A; two are 1A. The port labels are easy to read (black on white).The build quality appears to be pretty good. The ports are well anchored and didn't move at all when I stressed the cords. There&#8217;s a light that indicates the charger has power.I used it to charge a variety of devices. Totally uneventful, which is what I look for in a charger.The only downside is that the charger is not as portable as those that plug right into the outlet since you need to carry the power cord along with the charger. But, the ability to keep it on my desk more than makes up for that. This will be my stay at home charger.Well worth considering if you&#8217;re looking for a multi-port charger that can sit on your desk and not have to deal with a wall wart.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31d244IRyRL._SY300_.jpg

The best way to describe it is &#8220;elegant,&#8221; which is not often I term I use for a battery case. It&#8217;s sleek and conforms perfectly to the phone.I especially like how the case feels. It&#8217;s not rubbery, but it&#8217;s not hard plastic either. It&#8217;s hard to describe other than it feels great in use. It&#8217;s also non-slip, which is an added bonus for me since I tend to drop things a lot.Putting the case on is simple &#8211; just pop off the top portion, slide in the phone, and replace the top. Takes all of a few seconds to do. At the base of the case there&#8217;s a 4 LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; that shows the charge level remaining in the case battery. It&#8217;s clearly visible but not so bright to make it distracting. The case comes with a charge cable (micro USB to USB) for charging the case from any USB input.The phone always runs off it&#8217;s internal battery, with the PhoneSuit acting as a powerbank that you can turn on or off to recharge the phone. It will automatically stop charging when the phone battery is at full charge.Even the box it comes in is &#8220;Apple-worthy&#8221; in that it is stylish and high-quality, but still easy to open and get the product out without having to wrestle with a clam shell case. The packaging doesn't impact product performance, but it is so nicely done that it&#8217;s worth mentioning.The only issue that could be a negative is that it gets hot when charging. Not burn your fingers hot, but definitely more than just warm.This is a lot more expensive than a similarly-sized standalone powerbank, and even more expensive than a powerbank with far more capacity. But the fact that it doubles as a case makes this far, far easier to carry around vs. a powerbank. Highly recommend this as a way to extend the iPhone charge time.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41X9dARzXtL._SY300_.jpg

The &#8220;feet&#8221; at the bottom of the speaker are actually the control buttons for volume, pause, track skip, etc. You can either pick the speaker up and press the button directly, or you can just press the speaker from the top (there are markings on both the top and bottom as to button functions). I found that to be a novel and practical way to provide control buttons and non-skid functionality.The speaker itself looks very nice. It has a sliver plastic case with a fabric covered grill on the top. I do wish the grill cover was metal instead of fabric for greater durability, but the fabric appears to be of good quality.The sound quality is pretty good given the size. The bass is a bit light, and the mid-range is not as clear as I would like it to be, but again, for the size and price, it&#8217;s definitely more than acceptable.Pairing is simple and quick. The bluetooth range is pretty good, with no dropouts at a range of about 20 feet.Misses are that the button control markings are white on silver and very hard to see in anything other than ideal lighting conditions. It also lacks a 3.5mm input &#8211; the only way to use this is via bluetooth.Overall, a decent performer with an innovative, attractive design. 4.5 stars rounded to 5 since the design is so nice.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31-mR1BKPbL._SY300_.jpg

While multi-port chargers are easily found, this is the first one I&#8217;ve come across that has on/off switches for each port. For me, that&#8217;s a great feature since I can leave the device plugged in and just turn off that particular port on the charger rather than have to disconnect the device (I have some older devices that don&#8217;t automatically turn off when fully charged, so they need to be disconnected to prevent overcharging).It&#8217;s pretty compact considering there are 5 USB ports available. It measures about 4.5 inches long and 1.5 inches wide. The build quality feels decent, and the port plug (the cable you plug into your cigarette lighter) is firmly attached. The plug fit into the lighter socket very well and stayed in place.The charger comes with a small piece of Velcro tape if you want to mount the charger on (or under) your dash. I didn't need to do that since the 3 foot cord allowed me to put the charger on the passenger seat, but it&#8217;s a nice touch that it was included.Each port has it&#8217;s own on/off button and a LED indicator to show that it&#8217;s powered on. The max output is 8A (40watts). I didn't notice any heat build-up when charging two phones and a tablet.Nice design and a great choice if you want something that you can turn off the charging by pushing a button rather than have to disconnect the device.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31uIdaCsOXL._SY300_.jpg

It&#8217;s a very simple design &#8211; a lanyard with a clip to hold the device, plus a small stylus that clips on at the top of the device.The cord is very comfortable.

In addition to a 8000mAh capacity, it offers a digital readout of the charge level left, a dual bulb LED flashlight, a laser pointer and a UV light.The size is excellent considering the capacity. It's only 1.75 inches wide, 4.5 inches tall and 1 inch thick. That's quite compact for a 8000mAh battery. It weighs 6 ounces.In the listing the description says the case is aluminum. To me, it feels like plastic. That's not a bad thing since the case is fine as-is, with tight seams and a nice feel. But, it does not feel like aluminum.The end is flat allowing this to stand up without any wobble. The edges are rounded so it's easy to hold and carry.All the ports and lights are on the top end. It has 2 USB outputs (1A and 2.1A). The labeling could be better, but it's decently legible. All the lights are controlled by the single side button: 2 clicks and the flashlight comes on; 2 more clicks for the UV and 2 more clicks for the laser.Rather than an LED gas gauge, it has a digital readout. The screen is behind the case which makes it a little blurry, but still legible. I find the digital readout to be far more useful than a series of LEDs since it tells me exactly what's left in the powerbank.No problems with operation other than the button. It would occasionally stick unless it was pressed exactly on center. There is also a small amount of battery rattle (e.g., the internal battery moves a small amount if you shake the powerbank). Neither are huge problems, but collectively they drop my rating by one star.This has more features than any other powerbank I've used. While the UV light is not all that useful (other than for fun), the flashlight and the laser pointer are useful to have. Plus, the size-to-capacity ratio is excellent - it's a very easy way to carry around enough spare power for a full tablet recharge or a few phone recharges. Other than the fussy button, no complaints.[Sample provided for review]",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41RtIycVd-L._SY300_.jpg

The Moonstone performs just fine along those lines, but what makes it stand out is the design. It looks far nicer than any other powerbank I've used &#8211; it&#8217;s squarish, but has beveled edges that make it very comfortable to hold. It can also easily slip into a back pocket.It can be stood up on edge so the ports face up, or laid flat depending on what works best for what you&#8217;re charging. It rocks a bit due to the beveled edges, but stands upright without a problem.The case is made of high-quality plastic with tight seams. I have the green version and it&#8217;s a vibrant lime green. It&#8217;s a glossy finish, but not a huge fingerprint magnet (although it does show some).The travel case is also a standout. Unlike the usual nylon pouch, this has a felt-like pouch with an elastic cord to hold it closed. The pouch has two flaps so, in addition to the powerbank, it can hold cables, cords, etc. It looks great to boot! Really nicely done, and something that I&#8217;ve never seen with any other powerbank.Performance is on a par with other powerbanks, with 2 USB outputs (1.1A and 2.1A). There&#8217;s the usual LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; to show the charge level left in the powerbank. The capacity is 6000mAh making it suitable for one tablet recharge or a couple of phone recharges.The manufacturer strived to make the powerbank as environmentally friendly as possible, with recyclable packaging. It also comes with a &#8220;gift pack&#8221; of little items (a cord wrapper, a screen cleaner, a USB drive, stickers, etc.) which sort of flies in the face of being environmentally friendly. I&#8217;d prefer that the gift pack be dropped since it&#8217;s wasteful -- I&#8217;m sure many folks will toss out some or all of the items.But that quibble aside, this looks far better than the typical utilitarian powerbank while still offering solid performance. Two big thumbs up![Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/415Qlu8%2B0jL._SY300_.jpg

It clips onto the iPod with an adjustable lanyard, and also provides a set of earbuds.The build quality is pretty good. The lanyard seems sturdy and is easily adjustable. I didn't have any concerns that the iPod I was using it with would be flying off even when I was on the treadmill. I also like that the lanyard cord didn't irritate my neck even when it was moving around.The weakest link to this is the earbuds. The sound quality is not bad &#8211; it&#8217;s not what I would call high quality but, for the price, it&#8217;s reasonably good. The earbud comfort, however, was not as good. The buds have a small silicone edge that sort of helps keep them in place, but it&#8217;s nowhere near as effective as the larger size silicone caps that other earbuds have. While the current design is very compact (which is a plus), it doesn't score very high in terms of staying put in my ear when I&#8217;m moving, nor is it what I would call comfortable.While the earbud design knocks this down a star, I&#8217;m still pleased with the product overall. Well worth considering if you&#8217;re looking for a convenient way to use an iPod/iPhone in a hands-free way.[Sample provided for review]",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vNvHNSM0L._SY300_.jpg

It offers excellent sound quality and solid build quality. On the flip side, the user interface has a couple of (for me) major downsides. Depending on how you feel about the light display, this can be either be a unique speaker or something that&#8217;s a poor value.Full review: This takes the typical mini bluetooth speaker a step further by building in a light display that can be tied to the music being played.My initial impression was very favorable &#8211; it feels solid and well-built. It&#8217;s all plastic, but the plastic is of good quality. It is also very well packaged, which is a departure from the usual &#8220;just toss it in a box&#8221; approach that&#8217;s typically seen. Unfortunately, the brief user guide that comes with it is very sparse and doesn&#8217;t really go through the product features or explain them very well. A better guild should have been included given the price point. Also included in the box is a cable (more on that later) and AC plug adapter for recharging, and a very nice cloth carry bag.The sound quality is excellent. The upper and mid-ranges are clear; there&#8217;s ample bass that doesn&#8217;t sound muddy or boomy; and unlike other bluetooth speakers the volume range is excellent &#8211; you can really blare this puppy! Zero complaints about the sound quality be it in bluetooth mode or direct wired mode.The built-in battery is 1300mAh which gives it a longer run time than pretty much any other speaker I&#8217;ve used. Excellent!The user interface is tied to the remote. I don&#8217;t like that since I&#8217;m prone to losing remotes. Granted, this has a slot for storing the remote but should you lose it you&#8217;ve also lost pretty much all functionality from the speaker since there are zero controls on the speaker itself. For me, that&#8217;s a major negative.The remote is small and thin, with well-marked buttons that provide a good amount of tactile feedback. No complaints about the remote &#8211; I just find it problematic that it is a mandatory item to use for speaker control.In addition to the remote you can download an app for iOS or Android for control options. I found the app unwieldy to use versus the remote, but it&#8217;s an option, and also serves as a &#8220;backup&#8221; should you lose the remote.As is usually the case with recent bluetooth speakers, zero problems pairing this with a device. The operating range is also very good with zero dropouts at 20+ feet.You can also direct-connect the speaker to a device, but instead of using a standard 3.5mm to 3.5mm cord, you have to use a cord (which is supplied) that has a 3.5mm plug on one end, and a mini USB plug on the other. That&#8217;s not a problem except for the fact that you have to remember to bring that cable along &#8211; a traditional 3.5mm to 3.5mm cord (of which I have a bunch of) won&#8217;t work.The advantage to the unique cable is that it can also be used as a charging cable (the included cable has 2 ends: one is a standard USB plug; the other is the 3.5mm plug). So, while it is unique, it means you only need to carry one cord to both charge and direct-connect.The light show is what really sets this apart from other speakers. That&#8217;s hard to judge in terms of value. Personally, I didn&#8217;t care much for it. Yes, it was fun for a short time, but I use speakers for the benefit of my ears, not my eyes. After a few minutes of playing with it, I turned it off (in addition to a variety of lighting options, it can also be turned off completely).So, if you find the lights distracting or unwelcome, you can turn them off but you&#8217;re paying a lot more for a speaker than you should &#8211; there are a number of bluetooth speakers that sound as good as this at far lower price points since they don&#8217;t include the light show.My ratings:Build quality = 5Sound quality = 5Instructions = 2User interface = 2Direct connect approach = 3Overall value = 5 (if you&#8217;re into a light show); 2 (if you just like to listen to speakers)Overall rating = 4. It is worth considering, but if you&#8217;re main goals for a speaker are good build quality and good sound, you can accomplish those goals by spending less than what this costs.[Sample provided for review]",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51S5sVSE7hL._SY300_.jpg

Power Bank Includes USB Cable, Micro and Mini USB Adapters - Black","This is an impressively well-built mini powerbank. Unlike the usual rectangular or &#8220;lipstick case&#8221; form factor, it has a rounded profile on one side and a flat profile on the other side. It looks nice, and stands out from the usual designs out there.No complaints about performance. It&#8217;s a small-capacity powerbank (3000mAh) with a single 1A output port, so it&#8217;s best for small devices (such as phones, mp3 players, etc.) rather than larger devices (such as tablets).It includes a 4 LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; to show the power level of the powerbank. Those are a little too bright for my taste, but I like the color (green). It also includes a flashlight which puts out a considerable amount of light. The flashlight can also be set to flash on and off, which (to me) is a rather silly feature, but it can easily be avoided when using the flashlight.The case is metal and feels very substantial. It&#8217;s light (weighs only 2.8 ounces) but has a good, solid feel to it. The on/off button is easy to find and has a good click to it so you know it has been depressed.My complaints are that it does not stand up without a wobble. If you stand it up so the output ports are at the top, the flashlight lens protrudes enough that the powerbank does not sit flat. If you lay it flat on the flattened side, the power button protrudes and again, gives it a wobble. It&#8217;s not a big deal and not something that would lower my rating, but it&#8217;s a bit irritating.My other complaint is with the packaging. It comes in a clamshell package that is a BEAR to open! Seriously &#8211; why can&#8217;t manufacturers realize that breaking into a clamshell means the customer&#8217;s first words about their product are going to be a string of profanity. Create a package with the customer&#8217;s convenience in mind!!Those quibbles/rants aside, this works well, is well-built and offers good capacity for phone recharging without taking up hardly any room. Well worth considering. Just be sure to have a sharp knife or saw at the ready to get this out of the packaging.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31CmvJfn8eL._SX300_.jpg

Unlike most small speakers with internal batteries, this won&#8217;t have to be trashed should the battery no longer holds a charge. Excellent!The bluetooth feature worked fine, with simple pairing to a Kindle Fire and a Nexus tablet. The range was good, with zero dropouts at a 20 foot range. It also has the ability to be used as a wired device with a 3.5mm cable (included).The speaker itself has a rather unique shape &#8211; looks like a mini zeppelin. It&#8217;s a nice change from the usual round or square shapes out there. It has a bright blue accent strip around the metal grill, which looks quite nice.The build quality is decent. All plastic, but it feels pretty solid. The control buttons are on top and have a positive click when you press them.The controls include volume up/down, which is a nice addition and sometimes not found in speakers in this price range.The sound quality is good with ample bass and reasonably clear mid and upper ranges. It gets rather rough sounding at high volumes, but for normal listening levels it puts out a very nice sound. I was impressed with the bass quality given the small size of the speaker.The internal mic is just OK. It works, but the pickup sensitivity is just fair. It&#8217;s not bad enough to warrant dropping the rating by a star, but the mic is not the strong suit of the speaker.For the price, this is a solid performer. It won&#8217;t compete with high-end mini speakers in terms of sound quality, but it puts out very good sound, has solid build quality and, best of all, a user-replaceable battery.

The port indicators are clearly marked (white lettering on a black background) and the LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; (that shows the power level left in the powerbank) is nicely done and readily visible. Very impressed with the build quality.The overall design is also quite nice, with a flat bottom so you can stand it up without any wobble or danger of toppling over. The edges are rounded making it easy to slip into a pocket. The size is also pretty compact, measuring a little less than 2 inches wide and about 3.75 inches long. It&#8217;s just under an inch thick and weighs only 4.6 ounces.The flashlight option works well and has a very bright light. That&#8217;s a useful addition in the smaller powerbanks such as this since it is something that you can carry in a pocket and use the flashlight for finding where you dropped things.The feature list is a little light, however, for a powerbank in this price range. It has only one USB output port, rated at 1A. That&#8217;s fine for phone charging, but not useful for anything larger, such as a tablet. While the capacity of 5600mAh makes it best suited to smaller device charging, if it had a 2.1A port you could at least get a partial charge of a tablet out of it.It would be a 5-star product if it had more features (such as a 2.1A output in addition to the 1A one) or came in at a lower price. But it remains a very well-built powerbank.

It&#8217;s not fancy or involved &#8211; just a simple cradle attached to a ball and socket joint with a suction cup base. What sets it apart is that all the components are well-designed to work as they should. That&#8217;s especially surprising given the price point.The cradle has a quick release button on the back. Press it and the cradle arms snap open. Once your phone is in the cradle you can move the arms back into position to hold it. The arms use a ratchet system to stay put and provide a secure grip on the phone. The max width it can handle is just shy of 4 inches.The cradle arms have padding for extra grip and to avoid scratching the phone. The back of the cradle has an insert that, while not soft, helps provide a good grip.The ball and socket joint works well and has a pretty fluid motion. I especially like how the suction cup was done, with a lever that flexes the cup to provide solid attachment (provided that the surface to which it is being attached is smooth and clean).The only downside is that everything is made of plastic. It seems durable enough for normal use, but I don&#8217;t imagine it would stand up to any measure of abuse. But, for the price, the build quality is more than acceptable.Nice design that works well.

It&#8217;s roughly the same dimensions (about 1.75 inches wide, 4 inches long and just shy of an inch thick at the thickest point) as a flip phone and the case is styled so that it looks like it would open up. However, it&#8217;s a powerbank rated at 6000mAh. Given that most powerbanks are so utilitarian looking, I&#8217;m impressed with the thought that went into this design.The powerbank has a single USB output port rated at 1A (located at the top) and a micro USB input port for recharging the powerbank (located on the side). It also has a 4 LED &#8220;gas gauge&#8221; indicator to show the power level left in the powerbank, and a pretty bright single LED flashlight (turns on with 2 quick pushes of the power button). The power button is small, but is raised enough so it&#8217;s easy to find by touch. It has a nice positive click when pressed.The overall build quality is excellent. It is all plastic, but the plastic is of good quality, and the seams are even and tight. All the edges are rounded, as is the overall shape from front to back, making it comfortable to hold and easy to fit into a pocket. It&#8217;s mostly a high gloss black with a smoky gray accent strip around the front. All in all, it looks quite nice.Operation is easy and straightforward &#8211; just connect the device you want to charge to the USB port and let it charge. The 6000mAh capacity and 1A output rating makes it more suitable for phones and small devices rather than tablets.It comes with a decent mesh pouch that is padded, and a micro USB cable. The instruction guide is brief but mostly well-written (which is a refreshing change from the usual situation).My only quibble is that the gloss finish is a fingerprint magnet. Normally I&#8217;d drop the rating due to that but, given how nice this looks, I&#8217;ll keep the rating at 5 stars.Nice build quality, good looks, and easy to use.

Plus, if you&#8217;re attacked by a herd of feral cats, you can distract them with the laser pointer (my cats go absolutely nuts playing with a laser pointer).The 5200mAh capacity (plus the 1A output) makes this not all that suitable for charging a tablet, but it&#8217;s great for phones and other small devices.Highly recommend for the ability to carry extra power when camping, outdoors, or other such situations.[Sample provided for review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZhGn5wmHL._SY300_.jpg

I like things that look &#34;different&#34;. :)I immediately tried them on, as many in the ear headphones hurt, and are not comfortable to wear. Well, good news...this is a premium comfort set, that I could wear all day. One reason may be how incredibly light the unit is. The headset sits on your neck/shoulders, and a wire runs up to your ears, where you plug in the magnetic air buds. The set also includes extra air buds...a very nice touch.When I went to set up the unit, via 4.0 bluetooth, I was impressed again. Pairing was almost immediate, and could not have been easier. Also easy, are the array of buttons on the unit. There seems to be a separate button for almost anything you might want the headset to do, such as turning on/off, fast forward, play back...you get the idea.So, the big question...how do they sound? Well, these are not my $300 ear buds, but their sound is excellent, especially for a set at this low price point. The sound is very crisp and clear, which is what I want to hear when I have my headphones on. I really hate it when headsets practically mumbles, and lacks clarity, meaning I can't make out the lyrics in a song.The unit also has a built in microphone to allow handsfree communication. I really haven't had a chance to try that feature, but if I find out anything else about this set through more use, I will update my review.The Swage has 8 hours if playback time and can do 100 hours in standby time. This unit Rocks! I definitely recommend this set.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dprR3C59L._SX300_.jpg

It provides multiple recharges to almost any portable device that can charge from a USB port (I use it for my ipads and iphones). This battery is one of the larger ones on the market at this time, at 12000 mAh. For someone like me, who does a lot of traveling, this device has been extremely useful since, while I travel, USB charging ports, and electrical outlets can be difficult to find or unavailable. This allows me to also charge 2 devices at once.The NT 120R looks slick, isn&#8217;t too heavy (size of an iphone but thicker at about) has a wonderful grip/feel to it, dissipates heat well as it never gets hot, and is really a nice looking charger. The unit has 2 usb ports, one is for 2amp tablets and the other is a 1 amp for phones. The unit is very solid and I would not expect it to break if I dropped it by mistake. I also like that it charges fast and turns itself off when my phone/ipad is full charged. Nice touch.I tested my iphone 5S on it and it charged about 6 times!Although this NT 120R could fit in your jacket pocket (or bike pack, hiking pack, etc.) I think it is best not as a &#8220;day &#34; charger, but more as a travel charger. However, I also have it set up on my work desk so I can charge my Ipad and Iphone 5s at the same time.The unit, as expected with it&#8217;s large capacity, took about 9 hours to recharge and 11 hours when using my Mac. When it does need a charge, I just plug it in over night, which I have had to do only once a week.I would definitely buy this unit again.

It is grayish black, with 4 grey anti skid feet on it, and very handsome to look at. I think it is great that I can charge my phone, and no wires are required! So, if I am changing rooms to work, I can just carry the Qt80 and my phone where ever I go, and place them down, and my phone just keeps charging...no plugs required!I no longer have to look for an outlet, and instead of searching for a cord to plug my iPhone in, I just place the phone on my desk, on this small Qi pad, and it is automatically charging. It might not sound like much, but in the two days I tested it, I have found my iPhone is almost always fully charged all the time. This, just because of the convenience of being able to easily place it on a pad. Plus, you can use this to charge another device via cable.The Qi pad comes with it's own .3m micro charging cable and a 1.5m micro charging cable. The manual says it supports 1 Amp devices, like digital cameras, other phones and MP3 players...but I digress).The unit is approximately ~5&#34; x 3.3&#34; x .6&#34;, with a weight of ~7 ounces. The color is a grayish black (very handsome), it is light, and has a small footprint, with 4 anti skid feet on it, making the unit very very stable on my desk.This is a great in home/office unit, and is so convenient. Smart idea...I love it!If interested, I bought a Qi case for the IPhone 5s and it is working great.As I use it more, if I find out anything else important, I will update my review.UPDATE: 6/12/14:I was told that there is a high failure rate with the Qi's and the IPhone, so I want anyone considering this to realize that. This unit is NOT being sold as Apple compatible. I have had the unit tell me a few times already today that it is not compatible, but when I take the iPhone in and out of its case, it must reset it, because then it works.I will update as I see how it works in the coming days. :)",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41bpUcq9sJL._SY300_.jpg

They do not use a protective case. Then 3 weeks ago, the kids dropped their IPad 1 and absolutely destroyed it, because someone forgot to put on the Otterbox Auntie sent them. There is a moral to this story &#60;g&#62;. ;-)So, since the children's life and education was on their ipad, a replacement needed to be found. Luckily, Auntie just upgraded to the IPad Air and had my old IPad 1 just sitting in its box. So, I made a big care package and just sent it to them (it was tough as it looked brand new and I knew what it would look like in just 3 days &#60;vbg&#62; ;-)However, this time it was in an Otterbox which I was very tempted to superglue closed &#60;eg&#62;! Looking at that bulky, heavy and ugly Otterbox, I wished I could have replaced it with something much lighter, and cooler from Fintie, but could nit find anything. However, I did find Fintie's Galaxy cases, that I am discussing here, and included them in the gift box.When I decided I also wanted to protect their Galazys, but without spending lots of money, I turned to Fintie. I think they make some of the best cases, for the lowest prices! I bought each or the shield series for under $5 each! Go figure, as they told me the otterbox they looked at was about $100? Anyway, the point is, the Fintie cases I bought made the Otterbox look heavy, bulky and not nearly as nice looking. Even if it would protect my phone from a nuclear explosion, there is no way I would out that thing on my phone!I received a call from my very grateful relatives a week later. They loved the Ipad (of course, it was free &#60;g&#62;)! They said that the Galaxy note shield fit liked a glove, they loved it, and agreed it was a great alternative to the expensive otterbox.Just so you know, the Fintie cover is really constructed well, and will protect from much dust, dirt and water drops.It also has great coverage of all ports and it's jacket fits just perfectly. Although their is no front cover, I just sent them the top of the line screen savers. This saves a lot of weight and I still think their phones will be very safe. Besides, I just got their kids a new used IPad so mommy and daddy should keep their phone hidden from the kids &#60;g&#62;. Auntie has no more extra phones and pads if these break &#60;g&#62;. ;-)Bottom line is, if you have young children, get a heavy duty case. :)You don't need to spend a fortune because Fintie makes a great alternative at a wicked low price.

A very nice feature, especially if you travel with them.Finally, the unit is not very complicated to use and all of the buttons are easy to get to.The unit can go for 6 hours and then requires a 4 hour charge. After very use I just plug these right back in so they are always ready for action.For a headset under $50, this is a good choice.I was provided a sample for review purposes. The opinion is my own.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31KMI9MXTHL._SX300_.jpg

The white charger has an orange light, and the black charger has a lovely blue glowing one. This allows you to be sure you are connected... nice feature.I plugged my Ipad Air into the 2.1 amp slot, and my cell phone into the 1 amp slot. I charged the phone and tablet for about 45 minutes. When I checked them after 45 minutes, the 15 watt car charger was not even warm. I really thought the car charger would be hot like so many others chargers get. But this one was room temperature. Simply amazing.These chargers have to be one of the best performing car chargers available. It is so very useful if you work away from home or out of an office all day, in order to keep your devices topped off and constantly charged. They are very convenient and very well designed. The unit is very attractive and the colors make it easy to find, which is important to me.

I wanted to get my friend the same one, but I could not find an IPhone 4S that matched mine, but this is the same case without the kick stand.

Second, the edges have grooves on them that make dropping this case almost impossible. Third, the case goes on and off with no problem, and on top of that has not hurt my screen shield (on front and back). I really love this case!However, you have to realize this is an inexpensive case from China, so don't expect it to last a lifetime. At a few dollars, buy a couple.  ;-)Honestly, I do not understand why there are not more reviews here, this case deserves a try, but you deserve a case like this. Also, they come in a bunch of colors, including clear, so your can show your iPhone off. I like the S curve look with a bright color like blue or magenta, only because I can never find my phone and the color helps. :)Good luck! Please feel free to ask any questions.

At this price I will find many things to do with it to stay organized.I am not kidding, this unit is made well and at this low price I will be buying a lot more. I have cables sitting around with all my electronics, and I can keep these little items in here so I don't lose them. Great buy!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51p7IP5jS5L._SY300_.jpg

You have the option of an on/off switch however.The unit came in a very cool felt pouch (4.5&#34; x4.5&#34; when folded) that has two pockets, one for the charger and the other for the cord and whatever you can fit in there. ;-)Another nice surprise is the unit comes with a flat micro USB cable. This means less chances of tangling. The cable is 2 feet long.The box contained a bunch of little surprises in the box, including a cord keeper, a stylus, a USB thumb drive, home cover buttons, a suction cup to hold the unit, a cool pouch and lots more neat things.The pack can charge my IPhone 5s almost 2 times. The unit does not come with a lightening cable.This is the nicest battery charger I have ever seen.If my review helped you, please click on &#34;Helpful&#34; below.

I especially use them on those days when I am traveling, and must be able to reach my clients, or vice a versa. For me it is a matter of piece of mind. I like to have my battery attached to my phone, as well as another one in the glovebox.So, as the day goes on, if I need more juice, that is the battery case starts to run down, I just charge the phone and charger together as one unit, with the external battery I also always carry or leave in the glovebox. As such, will never ran out of juice or be searching for an outlet to recharge things.With OS7, I have not seen as many battery cases (that work) around.Obviously, the case makes the unit heavier and bulkier, but as I do not need to use this option often, I really don't mind, as long as it is compatible with OS 7.I am glad I found a battery pack that fits my iPhone 5s, and works with IOS7.

It is slim and fits right into my pocket.I already own the larger Jackery Giant 12000 mAh, and owning both makes sense as they have very different uses in my opinion. I carry this smaller one with me all the time.  Put is really an awesome, little device with a large capacity (5000mAh), powered by lithium ion cells.The unit comes with the battery, a USB cable, warranty, and a user guide.The Jackery size is:4.9 x 2.4 x 0.3  Really a nice, slim sizeIt contains one outputs: USB  5V / 1AWeight: ~ 5 ounces (Very reasonable for this many mAh's)With this Jackery Air unit, you can just feel the quality, with its aluminum case.  It is packaged perfectly, almost like the iPhone...very top end. It really is very sleek, modern and a good looking unit, with a lot of power. It looks nice sitting on my desk.What really caught my attention is you can leave this device unattended for months.  It has  advanced power lock technology with standby time of up to 6 months!It charged my iPhone twice on one charge, and I even used it to charge my Ipad mini.The unit comes with blinking LEDs to let you know the power left in the unit:- when the LED is green, you have up to full power (75% to 100%).- when the LED is blue, you have  40% to 75% battery life left.- when the LED is red, you have 10%  to 40% battery life left.- when the LED is blinking red, you have 10% battery or less battery life and it is time to recharge.I also find that the Air really charges quickly. I noticed that when I close my IPhone down, then it really recharges substantially faster then with it on. So, give it a try and enjoy!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31y9oFugQHL._SX300_.jpg

What a pleasant surprise! I've reviewed quite a few bluetooth speakers, and this one stands out for quite a few reasons!Here's what's so awesome:1. It's tiny, which means that I can throw it in a purse, glove box, gym bag, etc. without adding any bulk.2. I love how it can hang from things, which also makes the unit sound better because there's nothing to absorb the vibration. In my backyard, I just hang it in a tree, at the beach it goes on my umbrella, etc.3. The unit is really good looking. In fact, it looks a bit like a jet engine on the wings of an airplane. The grill in the front is a nice touch!and finally (most importantly)4. The speaker sounds incredible and boy does it put out a lot of sound. It has no problem filling a room with crystal clear music. The bass isn't too shaby either!In summary, I'm very impressed with this speaker![sample provided for honest review]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yMZFO1BdL._SY300_.jpg

(I wish my DSLR had this ability) The size of the unit isn't too big, and because I keep it in my camera bag anyways, I don't notice the weight, although it definitely weighs a bit more than the 10000mAh model.On plane trips (and most recently on a road trip), this is my family's best friend. More truthfully, it's my kids best friend because it keeps all our iDevices charged. This allows them to play that stupid Flappy Bird game rather than look out the window at the Pacific Ocean when we head down to San Diego.All kidding aside, this really is a lifesaver on long trips when you need to get stuff done and you don't have access to a plug.

It's nice that the case is waterproof, but the added benefit is that it's sand and dirt proof as well. Usually when I'm at the beach I have to be very careful with my phone when taking pictures and making calls because my fingers are all sunscreeny and my hands are always sandy. This problem keeps me from taking as many pictures as I'd like to. With this case, I can be a little more free with my iPhone photography and I can do things like throw my phone in the beach bag without worrying about sand ruining it. I love being able to get pictures, even when my hands are wet and sandy. In the past I'd have to walk down to the water, rinse them off, find a non-sandy part of my towel, dry my hands, and then ask the kids to reenact the fun that I missed during all that camera prep time.

It's easy to install, and amazingly I got no bubbles. I attribute this to the cleaning tools included (screen wipes, cleaning cloth, and electrostatic precipitation film)3. It keeps my screen responsive, which is more than I can say for my old one. In fact, I can hardly tell its on!4. It doesn't scratch!

And this is what pushes the uNu Aero over the top: it really doesn't add too much bulk to your phone at all. In fact it's not much more than a regular case, and certainly less than an Otterbox. More specifically, it adds about three credit cards in thickness (above a standard case) and a little over a centimeter in length.I love mine and will definitely be recommending it to my iPhone friends.[manufacturer provided review sample]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5189j%2BiIiOL._SY300_.jpg

As I was listening to the Modre at my desk and admiring the plastic coffee-sippy cup it came in, on a whim I put the speaker back into it's packaging and it made the already good bass response even deeper.

Here's what you should know:First and foremost, you've got to trust your bike mount. With others I've used (i.e. less pricey options) I've always worried that my expensive phone would fly off if I hit a bump just right. The connection on this one is so solid, that I found myself forgetting to take my phone off when the kids and I would stop on our bike ride (The Habit, Yogurtland, etc.) Note: the mount can be attached two ways: with 2 O-rings, or with zip-ties and the O-rings worked so well that I didn't even zip it on.In order to connect the phone, you simply pop it in a case and then pull down on the blue &#34;quad lock&#34;. Twist it on a quarter-turn, and then let the lock snap into place. One it's on, your phone isn't going anywhere. This system also allows you to put the phone in both landscape and portrait mode, depending on the application you're using.How am I using it?Initially, I used it for the GPS. My kids and I like to take bike rides though our community, and usually we just go out for X number of miles and then return. Our preference is to come home a different way than we came, so having the GPS right in front of me allows me to make decisions on the fly. In the past, I'd have to stop and plan our moves every once in a while, which spoiled the flow of our rides.After a few rides, I realized that the speaker on my phone was plenty loud enough to play music as we rode along. The phone doesn't get too loud, so it's not obnoxious like the beach-cruiser & ghetto-blaster combinations we see so much at the beach. I must say that I've lengthened many rides because my Pandora music mix was doing such a good job that I wanted to keep going.And finally, we like to use it for tracking our miles and rides using Runkeeper. This is great because we can set goals and tell our friends how much we rode.Note: The bike also comes with a clear cover for your phone. Because I didn't read about it, I assumed that it was necessary to have on the phone (it's just a clear top). While writing this review, I noticed that they call it a &#34;poncho weather resistant cover&#34; and that makes sense. When the case it on, the sensitivity of the screen is diminished but the case is really designed to put on if it were to start to sprinkle or if you were riding through muddy conditions. For it's intended purpose, it works great but if you won't be having these conditions, just leave it in your bag.Ultimately, this is a great, secure bike mount that works perfectly for my needs and looks great doing it. Because I write so many reviews, I don't often suggest products to my friends, but this will definitely be an exception. It's that awesome.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51UVyuMq6cL._SY300_.jpg
