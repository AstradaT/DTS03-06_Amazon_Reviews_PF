Re-dubbed etc., but watching Fantasia on the two film edition was absolutely amazing! The film has never looked this good and I doubt it will ever look better.As far as the issues with the tampering of this film, I am not a fan of censorship, overdubs or any alterations for that matter, but considering this film was supposed to be a continuing ever changing piece of art, I don't mind the changes all that much. Sure I would love for the Black Centaur to be reinstated in the film and the original voice track featuring Deems Taylor, but while the centaur was a choice of cowardice, the voice track change couldn't be helped at least from what I've read.While I can appreciate people standing up for what they believe it and fight against censorship or any other important cause, I feel to condemn this release for the few small edits is a bit harsh as no matter how tough you stand on this issue, things are not likely to change, we live in a different world where people are so fragile they can't handle the truth anymore.The good news is at least now on Blu Ray the edits are flawlessly smoothed over so you can enjoy the other 124 minutes and 45 seconds of the 125 minute film.  My only other complaint is that they dropped a lot of the great bonus material from the 3 disc DVD edition.This is Fantastia and like it or not it is going to be the Fantasia for future generations to know...maybe someday we'll see it unedited, but I wouldn't hold my breath on that!",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21V2WFB94PL.jpg

It's not the best from the tome period, but a welcome addition to any vintage horror fan. This film runs just over an hour and has some plenty of creepy atmosphere for those who enjoy the good old horror days.The print here looks very good and Universal has included some extras including lots of stills, lobby cards, posters and some on screen trivia about the film.

A trailer for Destroy All Monsters came on the screen! I mean Godzilla was enough to get me to go to the movies, but here was a film that had him and all sorts of monsters, some I knew and some I didn't.This film truly is a fan favorite of Japanese monster movies and how can it not be? It has a lot of great things going on in it. Alien Invasion, Mind control of the world's monsters and a finale battle that is crammed full of as many monsters they could find.I had owned a previous DVD edition, but it did not include the AIP soundtrack I was familiar with when I was a kid, so I bought the Blu Ray edition and not only does it have that dub, it has a second English dub and the original Japanese voice track. All subtitles are available too. It does not however have the U.S. title cards so all text on screen is in Japanese, It's not a dealbreaker by any means, but does that mean that this is a different cut of the movie I grew up with? I'm not sure.The film looks very good a few scratches here and there and some soft spots, but really this film has never looked this good on home video and I am very please with it. I have read reviews that this print is faded and it is not nearly as bad as those posters are stating. I watched it and I see a few scenes where the colors don't pop like we would like them too, but most of these old Japanese monster films were neglected for years so it is a treat to see this film(or any other of them)in any condition.One other note the AIP soundtrack as a few slight flutters when it starts, but it clears up within a few minutes, The other tracks do sound better as far as fidelity, but I want to watch the film the way I remember it.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WHYX16VJL._SY300_.jpg

'Jack and the Beanstalk' was one of the 5 films not included on that set, but finding a decent print on DVD wasn't going to be easy having been in public domain for many years. I tried a few different releases with some disappointing results, washed out and blurry video and low audio. I happened to come across a release by Goodtimes video and found the print to be very good. The color and picture are clear and despite having some scratches, it is a pleasure to see this film looking this good. The Goodtime release is out of print, but you can find copies of it for under $5.00. If you're a A&B; complete-ist, this is is the one you want....at least until a proper special edition is released.The film itself is fairly enjoyable for the young at heart and A&B; fans. It's of course very juvenile, but has its charms. If you grew up watching it, then you will have fond memories of it.

Many make-up artist and fans brings share many great horror fun memories with us here on this well made documentary that runs two hours.The DVD is released by a non profit organization (Witches Dungeon) which has a museum dedicated to the famous monsters and the actors who helped bring them to life. If you're a monster kid, buy a copy of this for entertainment and to help preserve the monster kid in all of us!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51OFDIq2wUL._SY300_.jpg

I realize there are many that think Disney produces the same basic story substituting new locations and characters, but if that is the case then so does Hollywood live actions films and Disney seems to be doing this better than anybody, at least by percentage...really how many horrible theatrically released animated films has Disney had?....answer?

This box set while no where near complete is a very good example of this man's creative low budget films. Castle's films were also known for their &#34;gimmick&#34; and even though he borrowed from other films from time to time I find his films fun and effective especially for the money he made them on.This 8 film set is a little disappointing to fans because 'Macabre'(never available on DVD) and 'House On Haunted Hill' are not included. At the MSRP of this thing, they should have included 'I Saw What You Did'(OOP) and Universal's 'The Night Walker' (not available on DVD) for good measure also and at the very least 'House on Haunted Hill' could have easily fit on the bonus disc with Spine Tingle The William Castle Story. How can you call this a William Castle Collection without including 'House On Haunted Hill'?The good news is we get three new to DVD Castle films 13 Frightened Girls, The Old Dark House and Zotz! and the extras from the individual releases of the other films all seem to be here, even though the language options are not. This is no great loss for me, but could obviously mean a great deal to others. I know some have been complaining about the packaging, but I really don't see any cause for alarm as the discs being placed over lapping might be a small nuisance, but unless you're taking these discs out hundreds of times, I don't see where the damage will occur? I've had many of these types of sets and none of mine are damaged. With a little gentle care, this design shouldn't pose any problems.The film transfers look very good, and the extras are interesting. It would have been nice if they would have included reproductions of some of the gimmicks used in Castle's films (i.e..the punishment poll and danger cards from 'Mr. Sardonicus' and '13 Frightened Girls' also the ghost viewer for '13 Ghost'). We are talking about a couple of pieces of cardboard here, but I'm sure Castle fans would have loved the addition of these items and more gimmick reproductions.The films vary in artistic quality, but all of them are fun and worth your time. I'm sure everyone has their personal favorites and depending on when you first saw each film might effect your opinion of your ratings from best to worst. I had never seen the three new to DVD and for me they are the weakest films on this set. I would have rather had 'Macabre' and 'House on Haunted Hill' on this set than those three films, but that is only my opinion. It would have kept the theme of horror throughout this set and then maybe they could have done a comedy Castle set later with the other films and a rerelease of 'I Saw What You Did'.This box set includes the following eight films that any Horror/Castle fans should enjoy. These are certainly a fun treat on Halloween.1) 13 Frightened Girls - 2 1/2 stars - This film is pretty silly, but I found it to be harmless fun. Some of the young girls are just awful in the acting department and I found this film to be a little slow moving for me to give this a better rating.2) 13 Ghost - 3 stars - A fun ghost story and I couldn't resist pulling out a pair of my 3-D glasses to check the scenes out where the viewers are supposed to watch though the ghost viewers. This is certainly better than the remake, but it's not one of Castle's best.3) Homicidal - 4 stars - This is one of Castle's best and pays a great homage to Psycho. If you've never seen it before, you are in for a treat and a big surprise!4) Straight Jacket 3 1/2 stars - Joan Crawford hamming it up with surprisingly graphic murders for the times.5) The Old Dark House - 2 1/2 stars - Not to be confused with the 1932 Karloff classic. I'm sure some like this one more than others, but I found this one to be slow moving with only a few fun moments.6) Mr. Sardonicus - 4 1/2 stars - The best film of the lot, great atmosphere and very reminiscent of a Twilight Zone episode.7) The Tingler - 4 stars - Another of Castle's best films with Vincent Price you can't go wrong.8) Zotz - 2 1/2 stars - If I had seen this as a kid I probably would have loved it. What kid didn't dream of having this power? but seeing this now for the first time, I found it to be a little slow moving despite the interesting plot.Overall this is a great set even though it should have been better. The DVD's should have came in individual slime cases and it should have included more films, but I can't fault this release for what it doesn't have, because what's here is pretty darn good.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51q1k7aeoHL._SY300_.jpg

The actors are believable, but they do things that seem very abnormal. I will provide a list.THE CONS1) It's freezing out and yet the characters are sitting with there faces exposed and even have their coats zipped down to expose their bare necks!? Any normal person would cover as much of their bare skin as possible. A wool hat can be stretched down to cover most of your face and those ski jackets have huge over sized collars that will cover up half of your head. This really took me out of the film as it just seemed very unrealistic.2) When the plow is right under them they do not react normally. If you believe you're stranded, you thrown things at the window of the plow which is right below you! HELLO! .....not a glove a freakin' ski pole right through the window!3)Jumping from the Ski lift!? OK... The first thing I thought of was to climb the cable back to the ladder on the support pole. If you were to jump you would at the very least hang down by your hands on the seat or someone's legs, maybe even make some sort of rope from your scarves to make the jump 40 feet instead of 60 feet.4) When the girl falls asleep, she has her bare hand on the metal bar instead of her gloved hand?There are more little instances like these that keep this film from being as good as it should have been.THE PROS1) Intense moments with fairly solid acting.2) Solid effects and fast paced story.****SPOILER ALERT!****3) People get eaten by wolves!*****END OF SPOILER*****I know that it's only a movie and I enjoyed it regardless of its flaws, but if the filmmakers had thought this one out a little better, this could have been one of the most unforgettable thrillers in a long time.Open Water is a much more believable film and much better too, but if you like these types of films this one is certainly worth checking out.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dd4-vQTnL._SY300_.jpg

I found the animation boring, the jokes mostly flat (sure there are a few funny ones) and the story pretty lackluster, although the ending does help to redeem this very forgettable film.

Being a teenager when this film hit theaters it just seemed like a decent little movie with a scary ending, but looking past the obvious horror points it really isn't. Carrie is a tragic story of an outcast, though not her own fault, she is because of her mother's (played deliciously by Laurie) distorted religious beliefs and interpretations of the bible.  Carrie and Margret White played by Spacek and Laurie respectively both give very believable and heart wrenching performances and it is those two performances along with the superb direction by Brian De Palma that keep this film from becoming just another teen horror film. The music score is also a standout and very haunting.The film is rather bold especially for the time period, full frontal female nudity(including on screen menstruation), teachers who strike, ridicule and torment students, it's not something we see in these politically correct times. While there is no real gore, it does have some terrifying moments and sacrilegious overtones. It's really a pretty shocking film and on par with The Exorcist only a few years earlier.The film builds slowly but it never drags, and what Spacek does with the finale is one of the most incredible performances in any film I've ever seen. The look of complete shock on her face after Chris's nasty trick has been played on her is so natural and feels so real. Things like this that happen on screen and that are conveyed this convincingly are truly rare. In a matter of seconds we see her horrified, then shocked and then completely numb. She envisions everyone laughing is at her, in part this is real, but part of it is her own imagination, she seems to be outside herself. She then goes into a trance like state before unleashing her revenge on her cruel classmates and everyone at the prom because she feels they were all in on it.The way Spacek handles the prom scene is absolutely fantastic and I doubt this scene would have worked as well with any other actress in it. Kudos to De Palma for his choices as a director in this scene too. In fact the entire movie is very well done. Laurie deserves credit too as she is disturbing and scary as Carrie's delusional overbearing mother. The finale in the White house has a nightmarish quality and is very haunting and when Margret White is killed her resemblance to the Jesus on the crucifix in Carrie's prayer closet is both deliberate and eerie.The shock ending which was a first at the time has never been more effective as a jump out of your seat moment and I usually don't go in for such trickery, but because it happens in Sue's dream it is plausible and well....it scared the crap out of me even on second and three viewings..heheI'm reviewing this film now because I watched it again after watching the disappointing remake. I watched them back to back and the original is superior by a country mile on every level. It's scarier, has better acting, pacing, direction and so on...I own the first DVD special edition with Carrie surrounded by flames on the cover, it is out of print, but I urge you to look for that version. The new Blu Ray has gotten mixed reviews so I'll stick to that edition until a quality Blu Ray comes along.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51TVQS4QQ9L._SY300_.jpg

The definitive Dracula always brought something special to any role given to him, even these lesser quality low rent productions. 'Devil Bat' is actually a very fun film with Lugosi giving it his all, sure the special FX are campy as is the idea(after shave lotion to attract giant killer bats!), but it is still very entertaining non-the-less.I have seen battered prints over the years and heard about this edition after it was OOP. I tracked down a copy at a reasonable price and prepared to be disappointed......I was NOT! This film NEVER looked any where near this good and that alone it reason to buy this edition. To sweeten the pot(so to speak), the extras are very nice, including a very interesting and funny commentary, listen as Bela Jr. and Ted Newsome seem to run out of things to talk about regarding the film. Fortunately, this doesn't hurt the commentary as they talk about Lugosi coming to America and Bela Jr's childhood with his father and rest of the family. The other extras include a repo Devil Bat poster card which is very nice, some trailers and a radio program featuring Bela Lugosi.I know a lot of people think these old films are rather disposable, but I can tell you that seeing them looking crisp and clean makes all the difference. I grew up with this stuff and I hope that future generations will see the positives to restoring these old films. I have heard that they have canceled future releases and the only other films released like this is 'Bowery at Midnight'...too bad, I would have loved to have seen many more of these films done justice.

I'm beginning to see why I lost interest in the franchise after Godzilla's Revenge. Godzilla VS Gigan is one of the low points in the series. Too many stock footage sequences and some shoddier than usual special effects are just some of the problems with this entry.It's also sillier than usual (if that's possible?) with talking monsters and cockroaches from outer space. It doesn't matter if they used word balloons in the original Japanese version, it's just really stupid. Godzilla seems to have forgotten all about his radioactive breath again and now he can swim like a speed boat whizzing through the ocean with his pal Angiurus. It doesn't really matter it's a Godzilla movie right? I like the big guy and I can accept all the silliness, but watching stock footage from an earlier Godzilla  kind of takes the fun out of these films.Okay, I don't expect much from these films, but the earlier ones seemed to have better production values and scripts. On the plus side, Gigan and Ghidorah make a pretty good tag team and when the rumble gets going it's pretty darn good.The DVD from Sony has a decent transfer and it's in widescreen, it also has options for Japanese and English language and subtitles.

Of course I wasn't expecting great quality, but hoped for the best. Considering my purchase price of 5 films for a dollar, I wasn't too disappointed, but I wasn't sure if visual and audio quality would make a difference in your entertainment experience. Let me tell you, quality does make a difference!On first look the prints look pretty good, but when you compare them to better ones, then you can see what you are missing. Many of these films are available in much better editions, but you will pay a premium price(in comparison to this set) for the upgrade. Some of the films may be missing bits of film and or scratches, dark images and general wear. The audio is OK at best, but most of these cheap films had terrible sound anyway.I DO recommend this set because it is a very inexpensive way to see whether any of these films are worth the space they will take on your video library shelf. Please bare in mind that seeing films that may be slightly edited(in some cases), having some scenes too dark to see or audio that is less than desirable can make a difference in your viewing pleasure and ultimate opinion of these films.While some of these films may not be available in any better condition, many have very impressive restoration releases.My ratings' for the video quality is forgiving as a lot of these films have only been available as unrestored prints that are washed out , edited and battered. Mostly everything here falls between 2 - stars and 2 + stars.1) Carnival of Souls (1962) - Cult Classic 4 stars film, print 2 + stars - Buy the Criterion 2 disc edition2) Atom Age Vampire (1960) Fun Horror 3 stars, print 2 - stars3) Creature from the Haunted Sea (1961) 2 stars, print 2 stars4) Nightmare Castle (1965) Cult Classic 4 stars, print 2 - stars edited - Buy the remastered complete edition5) Black Dragons (1942) Not Horror 1 star boring, print 2 - stars6) The Invisible Ghost (1941) 1 star boring, print 2 - stars7) One Body Too Many (1944) 1 star boring, print 2 - stars8) White Zombie (1932) Cult Classic 4 stars, print 2 - stars Buy Roan Group remastered edition9) Attack of the Giant Leeches (1959) Cheap Fun Horror 3 stars, print 2 - stars10) The Screaming Skull (1958) Effective Horror 3 stars, print 2 stars11) Beast of Yucca Flats (1961) Bomb 1 star, print 4 + stars This film looks too good for it's own sake and almost made this film watch-able12) The Terror (1963) Cult Classic 4 stars, print 1 1/2 stars I've seen much better13) Revolt of the Zombies (1936) boring, 1 star, print 2 stars14) The Giant Gila Monster (1959) Fun 50's Horror, 3 stars, print 2 stars15) The Fatal Hour (1940) Not Horror 2 stars, print 2- stars16) Dean Men Walk (1943) OK Horror 2 stars, print 2 - stars17) The Mad Monster (1942) Fun Horror 3 stars, print 2 - stars18) Maniac (1934) Unintentional laughter! 2 1/2 stars partial female nudity(topless) and a cat getting its eye popped out!

'Creature from the Haunted Sea' has a interesting sounding premise, but it is just so bad in all areas, acting, pacing, editing, silly sub plots and of course a ridiculous looking monster. The narrative is soooooo boring with no flavor at all to the voice over, it plays like one of those old school documentaries that you used to fall asleep to in grade school!The monster which we hardly get to see(and for good reason!)is one of the stupidest looking creatures of all time.

The sequel The Devils Rejects is a completely different animal. This is more a homage to 70's grind house exploitation flick. It's not a bad thing an I have to give him credit for not making the same movie he did the first time.The Devil's Rejects is different in tone, pacing and atmosphere. Once again Zombie enlists the talents of familiar character actors old and new. This time we get William Forsythe as a main character and Gregory Lewis, Pricilla  Barnes, P.J. Soles, Danny Trejo and Brian Posehn in small roles.I like the use of familiar faces in roles of victims as it allows us to care a little if they die without having to get to know them in this film. There is also lots of disturbing imagery in this film so it's not for the faint of heart. I only wish that Zombie would have used the entire Free Bird song for the finale, I mean it's a cool idea to use it the way he did so why not go for the gold and give everyone a eleven minute blood bath.The 2 disc unrated edition DVD is the only way to go as the Blu Ray is hardly an upgrade in picture and you lose almost all the bonus material from the DVD including a 145 minute documentary.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512Hb2hZa3L._SY300_.jpg

I've got so many horror films to catch up on! This DVD set contains five rare Universal films from the 40's. The prints are clean and there are some trailers, but the best reason to buy this set is because all the films included are seeing their first DVD releases!If your a Universal fan it's a great set. I will review each film as I watch them, so I will be adding to this. The first film 'The Black Cat' is a film I had never seen. When I bought the set I thought it was the 1934 classic with Karloff and Lugosi....I'm glad it wasn't as I already have that film on the Bela Lugosi collection.......anyway..... 'The Black Cat' on this set is a murder/mystery/comedy from 1941. The film stars Basil Rathbone and Bela Lugosi in a fun supporting character. I did like this fun film full of secret passages and things that go bump in the night. The next film 'Man Made Monster' is a very good Lon Chaney Jr. film. The Third film 'Horror Island' is a misleading title as there isn't much horror going on, on this island! It's actually a mystery/comedy film that doesn't have much comedy in it either. This is the weakest of the five films on this set. I have reviewed these films on the individual release or VHS release.

Instead of hordes of zombies running around like supercharged baboons or sloth-like undead roaming aimlessly, these &#34;zombies&#34; are alive and act fairly human(at least from a distance), but have a pretty mean disposition. Depending on how far gone they are, they can almost seem normal...I said almost. What makes it seem much more real is that they still seem to have a little memory of the former selves and react to people they know.

The barrel is pretty cool and works well with the unique design of the individual season cases. They are made of a nice thick acrylic type plastic that are held together by magnets. Each season or half season in some cases are in their own case which hold each disc separately.The bonus items are a mixed bag, I like the challenge coin a lot, but the apron is pretty useless. I haven't taken it out of the package. This is for two reasons, 1) I don't really care if I see it and 2) I don't think I could ever get it back in the barrel top again after opening it. I would have rather had a zip lock bag of the blue ice stuff (fake of course!) as a memento from the show or maybe a replica set of the challenge coins that were produced for each season given to the folks evolved with this fantastic TV show. The apron is a bonus item so who am I to complain...it does fit in the top of the barrel so at least all the content can be stored in one place.The barrel is pretty well made and I was lucky enough to receive one in perfect condition, but the outer plastic case was cracked and although it wasn't a deal breaker I would have liked to have kept it intact. I don't think I could have salvaged it even if it weren't broken as it was pretty hard to open without damaging it. I think a box  with protective padding would have been a better option for the outer package.The individual seasons have the same menus, but I think all the episodes have been re-mastered as they all look and sound great! I owned the original BR releases and the new box set shows a major improvement especially on the earlier episodes. All original bonus material has been ported over and the exclusive bonus disc has plenty to grab your attention.OK, now we get to the TV series itself and I can say I've never been more impressed or engrossed in anything made for the small screen. It is without a doubt the best TV series I've ever watched and I can't remember any other series that didn't lose my interest at some point. I watched the series from the very first episide and I was hooked immediately. This show remains engrossing from start to finish. The level of acting, storyline, camera work and editing is just incredible and at theatrical film standards. I'm not comparing this show to sitcoms etc. but for a TV Drama series, this show has set a new benchmark that will probably never be surpassed. I've never been a huge TV series viewer, I'm more of a movie guy. My idea of great TV programs are mostly old sitcoms (The Honeymooners, The Dick Van Dyke Show, The Andy Griffith Show, The Munsters, Seinfeld etc.) I've never been much of a continuing TV series watcher because most of them drag on and on way too long. I loved the first few years of The Sopranos and Rescue Me, but they ran out of steam in the later years. I can't imagine anyone being bored watching Breaking Bad.The box set sold out very quickly and from what I've gathered there will not be any more of these sets released, but rest assured, this show will see future box set releases, maybe a bit more standard in form, but Sony isn't going to leave so many viewers without options to buy this excellent series. Be patient, there's a new box set coming around the corner... I'm sure of it.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41L-c7lbLRL._SX300_.jpg

'Yes' is a band that has stood the test of time and has only gotten their due from the legion of fans that know great music(and musicians)when they hear it (them).'In the Presence of' is probably my favorite performance on this DVD with it's sweeping melody and inspirational lyrics. Even someone who isn't very spiritual will find it hard not be moved by this beautiful piece of music. Being a bass and guitar player, it would be nice to see more of Squire, but most bass players get the short end of the stick when it comes to camera time on video anyway. We also get some good shots of the orchestra which seem to really be into the music and do a fine job enhancing, but not overshadowing the core band.I saw an edited version of this show on HDNET which looked awesome. The DVD looks very good, but seems washed out by comparison to the HD version which has finally been released to Blu Ray, but from what I've read you do not have the option to not see the animated sequences that pop up during the concert. This was a function that was available on the DVD and it is a shame that feature wasn't carried over to Blu Ray.  I will add to this review once I've investigated further. These guys aren't getting any younger, but they play here with inspired feeling. Jon's voice is in great form, Squire is.....well he's Chris Squire, one of the greatest bassist ever....ditto for Howe on Guitar! While either plays like a teenager anymore, they both can still play with the best of them.The sound quality on this set is very good, maybe a little brassy when turned up really loud, but the mix is even and I could hear everyone fairly well. The second disc is a bit of a disappointment as the feature is pretty lackluster and the video for Don't Go is almost like watching the concert version again....hardly enough to dedicate an entire disc to.If you haven't seen this 'Yes' concert and you're a fan, then you should really like this one....just don't expect 'Yes' performing like they're in their 20's.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/6150N7K3Y6L._SY300_.jpg

He is so stiff and bizarre that it just takes you out of the entire fantasy. ditto the two servants there lines are so robotic, it just ruins the experience.THE GOOD news is this film has atmosphere to spare, if you can forgive these three actors for being caught acting! The Monster make-up is very good and the final fight between Frankie and Wolfie is better than the original in Frankenstein meets the Wolf Man! .....sure it's a little hokey, but isn't it supposed to be?

Filled with some of their greatest and memorable characters, the exotic setting lends to the beautiful animation. One of the funniest of Disney films with hilarious voice work by Robin William(Genie), Gilbert Gottfried(Iago)and Frank Welker(Abu), Aladdin also is one of the studio's most controversial with a couple of lines of dialogue being altered before and after the theatrical release. There were also some redrawn animation sequences supposedly done for the IMAX showings, but those showing never came to fruition and thus the changes weren't necessary. Unfortunately none of these alterations have been restored in this otherwise fantastic 2 disc DVD editionThe film looks impressive on this DVD set, but I have to wonder why this film hasn't been re-released to Blu Ray? (At least in the U.S.) It's certainly one of their most popular titles and it hasn't seen a new release to home video for a number of years now. I can only hope that it is because Disney wants to make the Blu Ray as spectacular as this DVD was coming from VHS. The film looks and sounds fantastic with vivid colors and explosive sound. The color palette is deep and rich and it screams for a Blu Ray release, but if that doesn't happen, this version is more than sufficient. This is one of Disney's longest animated films at 90 minutes, but you would never know it for the pacing and story just seem to fly by. The extras are plentiful with lots of interesting goodies including one of the best making of documentaries I've seen on a Disney film.

I know this film has taken a beating and I would have to agree that it is a little disappointing. I really don't know how it couldn't be. It just had too much to live up to. The biggest problem with this film for me is that Raimi didn't make it long enough. I think he knew this would be his last Spider Man film and he should have given this installment the length it needed to tie up all the loose ends from the first two films with the detail it deserved.This is a very good film thou and only in the area of Venom does it seem rushed. I think Venom needed another 20-25 minutes of time in the film before joining forces with Sandman. this would have given this interesting character time to develop. Venom is a unique character in Web Heads Rogue Gallery and he deserved more than just an add on in this story. He's stronger than Spidey, he knows who Spidey is, he is immune to Spidey's Spider Sense. I think the possibilities are wasted here and I think the extra time would have made all the difference in the world. Topher Grace probably wasn't the best choice to play the character, but he's similarities to McGuire's physicality make for an interesting choice if the character had been handled better.Considering all that is going on in the bloated finale, Raimi does a good job of keeping things moving without becoming too confusing. I know there are many changes to the comic book history, but you have to expect that sort of thing when a comic book character makes the transition to live action film. I think Spider Man 3 is a very good film and a fitting end to the series even if it's a little too ambitious.I've tried dissecting this film and taking out a villain and there just doesn't seem to be an easy way to do it. Take out Venom and we probably wouldn't have seen Black Costume Spidey, take out Sandman and the finale wouldn't have been as spectacular and since the new Goblin was already implied and so woven into the first two films there had to be closure there.The Blu Ray is a huge upgrade for visual and audio and they did the right thing for this film by adding all the bonus material from the 2 disc DVD edition. So buy the Blu Ray release and dump your old 2 disc DVD edition and enjoy this film for what it is... a fitting end to a great trilogy.",4.0,

MGM has not issued a free replacement for this set and has left a sour taste in many fans mouths.

I just don't understand why the numbers don't add up?Now about the volume 3 set, all 35 cartoons are unedited( not exactly as a fellow reviewer pointed out there is some minor cropping done in one scene to block out a certain character), one decent bonus and a newer T&J; short fill out the two disc set The cartoons look very colorful and clear, but there are scratches present, so a full restoration wasn't done. It really doesn't matter all that much as the cartoons look very good! It's just a little disheartening that MGM didn't feel these classic shorts were worth the extra trouble. Although the Cinemascope shorts included on this set look fantastic! I found that the audio was inconsistent from short to short, but none of them sounded muffled, just that some shorts were louder than others.The Whoopi Goldberg warnings are gone(thank you!), but if the warning would have allowed Warner to include the two missing shorts, I would have rather had the warning included!The Tom and Jerry cartoons on this set are very good, but I didn't like them as much as on the first or second volume. It is obvious that the animation and music are top notch and I still consider these shorts classic, but I must admit seeing so many cat and mouse cartoons in a short period was a little tough as the theme is almost always the same.The extras are a little thin on this set and probably used up what material was available on the first two sets. I bought this set new for a little over $8.00 and it is one of the best bargains I've seen in a long time. I'm glad I waited until they corrected the errors and also reduced the price. For what you get here, it is a hard set to beat for fans of the famous duo!Now release the Gene Deitch series of Tom & Jerry cartoons to complete the series( anyone remember Dickey Moe?).

Surprisingly well produced for such an ugly film with above average cast and great special effects. This twisted tale has some serious flaws, but I can not deny that this film stuck with me after watching it. It's a shame because with a little tweaking here and there this could have become a classic in the gore hound genre. Gore with a brain.... you don't hear that too often. This film doesn't have much brain and that is its biggest problem, that and it is a truly nasty unlikable film for most.A lot of the gore is visual autopsies, which can be gross, but because of the nature being medical it doesn't necessarily have to be truly disturbing. What is disturbing is the nature of the premise of this film and some of the murders which are brutal to say the least. There is a fair amount of nudity and sexual situations which is disturbing under the circumstances they are used in this film and I think with a little restraint here with better character development this film could have delivered a much bigger impact. I wish that the \medical examiners\"" acted more respectful of the dead while performing the autopsies as I think this would have made them all the more sinister when their true colors were revealed(think Hannibal Lector). Instead they just blast you with everything from the word go and it makes the film and the characters one dimensional.While it has its problems it does show a sense of style and has an ending that makes the ending in 'Hannibal' look like a children's fairy tale. For veteran horror fans only! Bon App&eacute;tit!""",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51uHifTRQPL._SY300_.jpg

The film is very funny with lots of nods to Jaws down to the way certain scenes are shot. I say this is a funny film, but don't think you're going to get off that easy because this film is extremely gory with some very convincing gross out FX! Fortunately(for the guys), there is lots of nude chicks to take our minds off of such unsettling horror! :-D!I really enjoyed this film and for what it is and it deserves a lot of praise, but......it could have been so much more if it had been played straight at times. It has that kind of potential, to be something truly memorable. This is a good film to grab some beers and a bunch of your friends and have a great time!

At the very least a few hearty laughs, but nothing could prepare me for what I was about to see. A monster film!? YES INDEED! My title suggesting that Dracula looks like Jim Croce (maybe Frank Zappa?)is a stretch, but it made me laugh as I wrote it as my title blurb.....also the actor playing Dracula looks about as much like Dracula as if Jim Croce wore a cape and painted his face with white grease paint. :-DI can not even imagine how someone sold this idea, but they did accomplish one thing, they ruined the good names of Dracula and Frankenstein forever! The film has it all, atrocious acting, horrible special effects and make up and above all, a ridiculous and tedious script! I must admit that the film was a little bit better than I expected, partly because I was seeing it in HD on MGMHD network and of course it is unintentionally funny at times.I'm going to skip to the funny part which is the battle between Dracula (who is covered in white grease paint complete with two inches of black grease paint around his eyes and vampire teeth he bought at the nearest 5 and 10 store) and Frankenstein (I know, I know Frankenstein's monster...lets just get this over with all ready!) Frankenstein looks like a cross between Mr. Potato Head and a Cabbage Patch Kid left at the city garbage dump for a decade. I skip to this battle because the rest of the film is just excruciating to watch, but at least the battle is hilarious enough to warrant a review. Dracula literally tears Frankenstein apart limb from limb just minutes before sunrise. Dracula then slowly burns to a deep crispy skeleton with obvious cut-aways every few seconds to change the prop Dracula to the next stage.

At just under 70 minutes long this film is loaded with monster scenes taking up more than half of the film..... Is it silly? sure it is, but aren't most Godzilla films a little silly?I am only familiar with the early Godzilla films (this being the last one I remember vividly) and the original film aside these films are all pretty silly. A talking baby Godzilla may sound ridiculous, but it is in the child's fantasy that it happens and it helps to propel the story.The fact that Minilla (Baby Godzilla) helps him to stand up to his bullies is actually kind of brilliant for a kids movie. I also found it interesting in real life how we have gotten away from teaching our kids to be able to take care of themselves.When I was growing up my parents both worked for a time and my mother had me come home from school for lunch, put my dishes in the sink, lock up the house and go back to school. I repeated this every day until she thought I could take care of myself on my own. I was 6 at the time and I never burnt our house down or hurt myself...I never even lost my house key. Today kids need to be monitored until they leave the nest it seems. No common sense and totally unprepared for the harshness of the real world.In this film Ichiro is lonely because both of his parent have to work long hours to support the family, he is on his own and with only a friendly neighbor to look in on him from time to time the boy spends a lot of his time dreaming of Monster Island. So while this is certainly a unique Godzilla film, I find it inspired and very enjoyable, because if you're taking Godzilla films too seriously, you're not getting it at all.The Classic Media DVD has both Japanese and U.S. version of the film and it looks quite good, nice clean picture and sound. There are some stills and short feature-ette on Ishiro Honda so over all I can't see how any Godzilla fan would pass on this one.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Eq6alTMbL._SY300_.jpg

The Pianist is very unique in terms of the way it is handled. We see these horrible events through the eyes of one person.

This send-up hybrid of Sci-Fi/Horror/Comedy which pays tribute to all those old classic (an not so classic) Sci-Fi movies of the 50's is highly entertaining! The film starts out with some rather silly looking aliens chasing each other around their spaceship. One of them discharges an &#34;experiment&#34; out into space and it comes crashing to earth.The next scene is a flashback sequence of the 50's and is very reminiscent of 'The Blob'.

The film's tone is like most 80's high school movie with one character being too shy to talk to girls and his quirky buddy who knows no fear. This film is pretty over the top and it works mainly because it doesn't take itself too seriously. There is some mild gore and some true tension in this crazy mix of comedy and horror.

This particular release of A&C; meet Captain Kidd is not as bright(color wise)as I would have hoped but it is still very pleasing.This is sort of a holly grail for A&C; completist along with Rio Rita(also released by Warner Archives). I have had problems with certain titles in the past that were DVD-R, but Warner will send replacement for defective discs. Their policy changes frequently and sometimes they will send you a replacement without returning the item and others times they have you send the disc back and they will reimburse you for shipping charges. It's a bit of a pain in the A $$, but if you want these films in your library, then its a risk you'll have to take. The films are expensive, but Warner has us over a barrel. They do run sales now and then, so you can buy them cheaper then 19.99 if you can hold out.The movie is a fun A&C; adventure tale of high seas shenanigans with Charles Laughton giving his all as the title character.

When I heard about this remake I was excited, but after reading many reviews I decided to wait until it came on cable before seeing it. I happened to come across this Blu Ray very cheap and I took a chance. To my surprise, this remake isn't as bad as many have claimed, but does nothing to improve on the original either.The special effects are a highlight in both versions, but in this film they are used sparingly. You never get a good look at the monsters, only quick cuts and fast motion I assume to hide the cracks in the CGI work? I know the younger generation see Ray Harryhausen's(RH)work as old fashioned or even quaint, but he is one of the pioneers of the craft and has and will continue to inspire generations of film makers long after this remake disappears into obscurity. It was fitting of the makers of this fim to put in a cameo of BoBo the owl as a nod to RH.The story has been changed, but not for the better, only adding confusion and depriving us of a real hero. In RH's original film the story was more straightforward and even though a little corny at times, it did a better job of keeping the motives of the characters more believable.Back to the special effects as this is really the reason to watch any Harryhausen film remake or not. I'm glad that they kept RH's design for Medusa as is it one of the coolest interpretations of her, even though not accurate by Mythological standards. As far as RH's stop motion work, I really don't think people are aware of the amount of work that RH put into the Medusa sequence in the original. Medusa's snake filled hair, her tail and all body movements are painstakingly done with the upmost finesse and skill. Even more amazing is that the flame lit lair is also something he had to take into consideration. Switching the light reflection frame by frame to make it look like flames flickering. Add in the fact the man was in the twilight of his career at almost 70 years old! It was nothing short of breathing taking in its time and I doubt it could ever be duplicated. If we factor in the money and time allowed to create this and all the other creature effects, it is unbelievable that it was completed. I would have loved to see what he could have done with a budget of the remake!The Medusa in this film looks very good, but I think there is more tension in the original scene with her slowly stalking her intruders. In fact, most of the creatures in this remake serve only as a reminder of how great Harryhausen was at his craft, giving his creatures life and personality. The original film suffers from budget restraints that actually effect the look of the film, as all the prints I've seen of it are dark, grainy and the matte shots stick out like a sore thumb, so naturally this remake looks incredible by comparison.The original has more creatures and the story is told in a more entertaining way, but the remake has some impressive special effects and a story that is not as corny. If only we could combine the two to make one great film. Clash of the Titans is a solid action adventure film with some nifty effects, but I will watch RH's version far more times than this one.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZYve9W9TL._SY300_.jpg

Seeing only a single DVD release 14 years ago and no Blu Ray in sight, it is a mystery why the studio deems this excellent animated film unworthy of a quality release to Blu Ray.The animation has a classic feel to it that reminded me of the late 30's early 40's Walt style of shorts. The snappy uplifting score framed by the Gospel singing girls makes this an absolute pleasure to watch.The Gold Collection DVD may have been adequate for the times, bit it is sorely out dated and a new edition is truly warranted. The first thing I noticed about the aspect ratio and presentation is while it is 1:66:1 it is not anamorphically enhance, so the film is completed surrounded by black! It's not so bad on my 150 inch movie screen, but I would imagine on a 40 inch TV this would be horrible. The film looks fairly clean, but after viewing so many of their other titles In high definition, it pales in comparison.Why Sleeping Beauty is getting another Blu Ray release this year instead of this film, Aladdin or even 101 Dalmatians is beyond me.If you want to enjoy Disney's Hercules, then this is really your only option (VHS or Laserdisc), it's not really bad, but should be completely overhauled.**** UPDATE*****Hercules received a very quiet Blu Ray release. The film looks great on Blu Ray, but sadly there are only the same short SD bonus materials included.

Its got some really great sequences and music, but It's a shame that Fantasia 2000 isn't the groundbreaking film it should have been. It's actually very good, but lacks any real WOW factor and having multiple persons introduce the selections wasn't a great idea, it makes the film feel more like a documentary or TV special. The Sorcerer's Apprentice shouldn't have been part of this new continuation either.When Walt first envisioned this being an on going ever changing thing, he didn't have home video in mind. No one wants to watch this and Fantasia back to back and see the same segments twice. What I find funny is the original Fantasia is 60 years older, but the animation seems much better and groundbreaking even in these times. I think they should have pushed the envelop a little further, it should have been longer with more segments. ..and why the Salvador Dali piece wasn't included in this film is beyond me, it should have replaced The Sorcerer's Apprentice repeat.

Newer sets of the same release have the corrected disc intact, but if you happen to get an older stock set, you can have the corrected disc sent to you for free.Now that the set has all unedited cartoons, lets talk about what we get on this volume one release. First, we get 40 cartoons spread out on the two discs 20 on each. The cartoons look very colorful and clear, but there are scratches present, so a full restoration wasn't done. It really doesn't matter all that much as the cartoons look very good! It's just a little disheartening that MGM didn't feel these classic shorts were worth the extra trouble. Although the three Cinemascope shorts look fantastic! I found that the audio was inconsistent from short to short, but none of them sounded muffled, just that some shorts were louder than others.The Tom and Jerry cartoons on this set are really special and it is obvious that the animation and music are top notch. I found myself laughing out loud at many of these cartoons, but I must admit after seeing 40 cat and mouse cartoons in a short period was a little tough as the theme is almost always the same.The extras include a documentary on the animation with the Hanna Barbera team and another devoted to the music uesed in the shorts. This is where MGM shined as the music is above and beyond anything used in animation to this day. The other extras are two live action/animation blended excerpts from movies, one from Anchors Aweigh featuring Jerry and Gene Kelly and the other from Dangerous When Wet featuring Tom and Jerry swimming with Esther Williams.I bought this set new for under $8.00 and it is one of the best bargains I've seen in a long time.

At a bargain price, this set features 32 cartoons and for the most part they look very good, with most of the wear being at the beginning of each short during titles and the first 30 seconds or so of the shorts. Have they been remastered? .....probably not, but besides a little wear here and there, they are presented uncut and look pretty clear and not washed out. About a third of the cartoons are black & white and the rest are color.The set has a pretty basic menu, but my only gripe is the menu could have used a little work to make it a little more user friendly. You can play all the cartoons or look at the scene selection for individual titles, but once you start the cartoon from any point, it will play all from that point. Meaning you have to stop after each cartoon and go to the menu if you want to skip around and see selected shorts. It's not a huge deal, but it could have been easily fixed with a few adjustments.Is it worth buying, absolutely! it has 32 rare shorts that may never look any better or be released again. At a tad under $10.00(or cheaper if you look around), you get a nice collection of cartoons from a man who was a pioneer in animation. The shorts are not the best he produced, but I enjoyed these cartoons very much. .....hopefully volume 2 corrected the menu problems.

It's got great characters, action, acting and heart, it's one of the best popcorn flicks you'll ever see. Tobey McGuire may not be the wisecracking Spidey we know from the comic books, but he is completely believable as the young teen with these strange new powers. Dafoe is perfectly cast as the Green Goblin even if the Goblin design could have been a little better. I also loved J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Dunst, Robertson and Harris are great as M.J. and Uncle Ben and Aunt May.Sure there could have been a lot more development with Parker getting used to his new powers, but I believe this series was known to be a trilogy right from the get go and Raimi wanted to make Spider Man 2 all about the problems that would come with these powers and as we all know he pulled that one off in spades. When you think about the genius of how the first film was handled with Parker not giving much thought to the dangers of his new found gifts, it's a really good choice to not have over emphasized that point. I also love the ending of the film which I know also made all the ladies big fans of this film. There is nothing quite so bitter sweet as unrequited love. Besides being an extremely fun film it is also a very important one because super hero films had not been taken very seriously until after this film made a ton of money.The Blu Ray is an improvement over the 2 disc DVD set, but many if not all of the bonus material was not carried over, so hole on to your DVD sets if you want to upgrade as the extras are well worth it.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5108SSFB9GL._SX300_.jpg

The animation in this film is outstanding, but unlike Atlantis in this adventure we do get a song(which I found unnecessary), but it is more like a rock video than a musical number. This is a hybrid film combining hand drawn animation with CGI. It's kind of like Treasure Island meets Star Wars.On to the product itself.

I've never read the story so I'm not sure if this is more faithful to it or not? Hoping for the best, keeping my expectations low and wanting to really like this film. I watch yet another failed attempt to remake another classic with horrifying results.Moretz and Moore are more than capable of giving excellent performances and they do a fair job, although I thought neither were nearly as effective as the original versions of these characters played by Spacek and Laurie. The remake fails more in the direction department. There is no build up to the climatic ending in this remake. Even though the film is pretty much scene for scene the same film, the direction and over blown sequences show just how Hollywood has gotten away from being able to tell a good story without catering to the ADD crowd who need an explosion every 2 to 3 minutes to keep their attention.Everything in this remake is overblown, forget the simmering pot pacing of the original as it slowly builds to a heart pounding climax, the power of telekinesis in this version is so absurd and to the point of ridiculousness, her powers rival that of the strongest of X Men mutants, able to split streets and swallow up cars etc. I suppose if I had never seen the original I would have been entertained by the two leads here, but having known and loved the original it just pales by comparison on every level.

I also own the 6 VHS director's cut which puts the three films together in chronological order and adds well over an hour of great footage (My favorite cut by far!). I was contemplating buying the new restored Blu Ray edition and I'm very glad I decided to go ahead and buy it.Like a lot of other reviewers have stated the films look better than they ever did, but naturally they do not look like state of the art films made recently. The Blu Ray version is a very noticeable improvement and the films look bright and as clear as they will probably ever look. Coppola wanted a certain grainy look and to remove it completely would be like scrubbing the grit out of The Rolling Stones classic album 'Exile On Main Street'!Of course I'm talking mainly about the first film as part II looks better although many scenes are still a little dark.  Part III looks exceptional and helps the overall experience of the film since it is by far the least of the three. The extras disc is full of hours of good stuff for hard core fans to navagate through including the extras from the 2001 DVD release which was a nice addition.The first film is the greatest mob film ever made with the second film rating a very close second (maybe a tie with 'Goodfellas for second place?). Part II has a much more ambitious story and probably deserves top seed, but the character's of Don Vito(Marlon Brando), Tessio(Abe Virgoda), Clemenza(Bruno Kirby) and Sonny(James Caan)are sorely missed in part 2. That's not to say that the second film doesn't have great characters, I just prefer the original characters to the characters in part II.What is incredible is the casting of Don Vito(Robert DeNiro), Clemenza(Bruno Kirby) and Tessio(John Aprea) in part II, it's very believable that these young guys are those older guys in the first film. The very underrated John Cazale gives a fantastic performance in part II as Fredo. As good as Pacino is in these films, he is not very likable and I find the other characters more appealing and interesting. I could have watched an entire film just following the young Don, Clemenza and Tessio for part II.I know the third film has been bashed to bits, but how could part III have not been a disappointment? With what it had to live up to, it's surprising it was ever made. I have grown to like it more over the years. If only Duvall and Coppola could have come to a money agreement, I think the film would have been much better. For one it would have added another brilliant actor in the film and maybe that would have forced Coppola to edit out some of the religious overload.If you have a Blu Ray player this is a must have as these films will probably never look better. My only gripe is they should have made this a deluxe box set with the director's cut of all three films included too, it has never seen a DVD release. I guess, I won't be retiring my VCR just yet. It's an amazing piece of work with a lot of stuff that was cut out of the original films. I'm not talking throw away stuff either, it's as close to watching a book as you'll ever get. Hopefully they will release it someday soon!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41yBN5Ti01L._SX300_.jpg

It is easily one of the most significant sitcoms from the early days of television and yet we are treated here to one of the most bizarre releases. First off, out of nowhere, we start with season 5? I realize that some of the early episodes have fallen into public domain, but it is still a bit off putting.There is some good news here and some bad news, first the good news, the set can be found for under $10.00 now and the makers of this set were nice enough to include the last episode of season four to get newcomers up to speed with the new version of this sitcom. In the first three seasons Danny had a wife, but the actress Jean Hagen didn't get along with Mr. Thomas(or so I have read)and quit the show. Thomas didn't think the show would work without her, but they decided to add a new actress Marjoie Lord as a nurse maid Kathy O'Hara to the kids and have the wife die(off camera)to write her out of the show. At the end of season four she(Kathy)proposes to a shy Danny and the new stage is set for season 5. The other piece of good news is that they included the episode in which The Andy Griffith Show was created from as a bonus along with 2 other bonuses, Martin & Lewis Telethon appearance by Danny Thomas and a short tribute to Danny founding the St. Jude Children's Hospital.The episodes run around 22-23 minutes and look OK( the season 4 finale looks the best by far), but could certainly look better. More than the soft picture is that fact they are edited or they would run around 3-4 minutes longer. Part of the reason for episodes being shorter is that the opening theme is seen only once at the beginning of each disc and then the episodes start out in the first scene. This could account for at least 30 seconds of the episodes length, so the edits are probably minimal but still irritating. I do rememeber this show, but not well enough to know what is missing, some scenes are obvious and others aren't.The extras are a little light and the menu screens are the only place the episode titles are present. Overall, I recommend you buy this set, but prepare to be disappointed a little. This show deserves a lot better than this and from what I've read the new company that released season 6 made major improvements. I'm just getting ready to start that season and I will review my findings when I'm finished.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51MHNNDS7QL._SY300_.jpg

It's the version I grew up with and isn't that the reason we watch any of these films? To remember a simpler time when men dressed in silly monster suits destroying cities were just fun to watch?  It's probably the best version out there, but I hope someday that this and a few other Godzilla titles get the U.S. versions we all grew up with.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/214S1XMPGGL.jpg

That's not to say that this could quite possibly be the greatest super hero movie of all time! It's got everything a great super hero film needs, great story, acting, pacing, action,hero, villain, love interest and a touch of comedy. Spider Man 2 also develops the character and answers all the questions the first film didn't fully flesh out. I thought Alfred Molina (a guy I had never heard of at the time) was absolutely fantastic as &#34;Doc Ock&#34; . The FX look better and the fight scenes are more appropriate for our web slinging hero with high flying air battles, Spidey shooting web balls and a villain who looks much more like his comic book counter part.Besides having great action sequences Spider Man 2 also has a lot of heart and the love relationship and guilt issues keep this film from becoming just another super hero movie. The blend of drama and action would not be complete without a pinch of comedy which this film hits on every cylinder. Whether it's Spidey delivering pizza, taking an elevator ride or the hilarious use of the song 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' this film has some wonderful funny moments.The Blu Ray is an improvement regarding visuals and sound, but doesn't carry over the wealth of bonus material from the 2 disc DVDedition, so you may want to hold on to it. Spider Man 2.1 is an interesting DVD set too, but the film is superior on the theatrical version The extended edition is pretty cool for those who want to have everything and there's a ton of new bonus material on that set to make the purchase more tempting.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51529JJX43L._SY300_.jpg

The show ran two seasons and fortunately was retooled for the second season. The first season is not all that good, but not a total disaster. The worst thing about this set is that there are no chapter breaks. Which means you must sit through that awful theme song time and time again (I fast forwarded through it after the first episode). On the plus side, the theme song was removed after season one and season two has a new improved intro. It would have been nice if there were some bonus material on this release, but there is nothing worth listing here.Season one is very juvenile, I know it's a kids show, but there are many super hero cartoons that aren't this corny and the animation is pretty bland. It does get better as the season goes along with appearences by Sub Mariner and The Super Skull.Season two is where if really takes off. Better animation and stories with guest appearances from Daredevil, The Hulk, Thor, The Silver Surfer, The Inhumans and Ghost Rider. Of course the FF's main villains are here Dr Doom, The Mole Man and Galactus to name a few. There are a few very brief cameos by The Vision, Hercules, She Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and The Scarlet Spider.If your a fan of the series then you will want to pick this up, but I can't see paying $40 to $50 for this though. It's easy to find for under $10. All 26 episodes on four picture discs, each featuring one of the 4 team members. The only extras are introductions by Stan Lee which are well....you know Stan!....ZZZZzzzzzzzz.Overall the series is pretty good, but I prefer 60's Spider-Man and DC Filmation to this stuff. Although season two is a huge improvement and really quite good. This series just doesn't hold the magic of the earlier stuff for me, probably because I grew up watching the early ones. If you grew up in the 90's then I'm sure this is more nostalgic for you. If they had added chapter breaks and added a few extras I would have given this another star, but this is a lazy release that should have been better.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519XN1TVT6L._SY300_.jpg

This release by Legends has done a very good job of presenting a clear and bright looking picture with good sound. Has it been restored?...probably not completely, but it looks very good, with minimal wear and I found it to look (way) more than adequate.The extras include three unrelated shorts which don't look as good as the feature film, a brief(readable)bio on Fleischer studios and the original trailer for 'Hoppity goes to Town'.

I grew up watching Johnny Weissmuller(my personal favorite), but I saw many films with the different incarnations of the &#34;Lord of the Apes&#34; in them.I saw Tarzan's Three Challenges in a theater back in the 60's because my local theater would show films that were a few years old at matinees on Saturdays. This was great news for me as I was able to see films like 'King Kong VS Godzilla', 'Jack The Giant Killer', 'The 7th Voyage of Sinbad' and 'The Planet of the Apes' a year to several years after their initial theatrical release in a movie theater!Tarzan's Three Challenges is one of the most enjoyable of all Tarzan films with a straightforward storyline, great use of exotic locations and some well staged action. Jock Mahoney always reminded me a little of Weissmuller and I thought he made a very good Tarzan. This DVD is one of many that Warner Archives has released through their website. I've bought several rare titles through them and have been pleased overall.I have had a few defective discs that Warner quickly replaced. The titles come with no frills, but the films look very good....no re-mastering has been done.

The original The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh was actually three shorts sewn together for a theatrical release, so this is the first time that Pooh gets a true theatrical released movie. The film is rather short at 63 minutes and while entertaining(more for small children) I didn't see the point of this being a theatrically released film considering the string of great films that immediately proceeded it.The Blu Ray looks fabulous though and while a lot of the original voice actors are gone now, they did find some amazingly close sounding voice talent for some of the key characters. The animation looks like a perfcet continuation from the first film and I love the addition of Zooey Dechannel's music. It's a cute movie that is probably more well received by children, but being a collector of all Disney theatrical films I could have done without this one. The 3 disc Blu Ray is short one with a 63 minute film, 2 shorts and some bonus material that won't take long before all is exhausted. I also find that since there are so many complaints in these times about bad role models for kids in animated films(Vanelope from Wreck It Ralph etc.), it seems laughable that no one seems to mind a lazy, begging bear who will connive his way to a free lunch of honey any chance he can get!

I found it very enjoyable with top notch animation and story as usual from the kings of animation studio.Starting out in outer space almost like a sci-fi serial, but soon finding another exotic location on Earth in Hawaii Stitch lands and slowly connects with a young girl. Stitch is by far one of Disney's strangest characters, but he does grow on you. It's not the best Disney animated film ever made, but it is different and a worthy entry in the on going Disney animation cannon.The 3 disc Blu Ray combo is a bit misleading in that it is one Blu Ray disc and two DVD's. The good news is the Blu Ray transfer is flawless! It looks and sounds amazing, but that is where the amazing part ends. The previous 2 disc DVD had a enormous amount of extras on it, but I couldn't find any on this set,..at least not on the Blu Ray disc. The DVD's do hold some of the extras from the previous edition, but it isn't stated on the package. For a company that is so aware of marketing Disney certainly doesn't seem to be listening to their customers. I have bought these films over and over again so and I know I'm not alone, so I think my concerns are just as valid as Mom and Dad buying randon animated films to introduce to their kids. I have had to keep at least 70% of my old Disney DVD's because of the loss of great bonus material on the Blu Ray editions, or not including multiple aspect ratios where needed. It's ridiculous!Sure it includes the sequel(who cares?), really?.. how can Disney keep doing this over and over again? I guess so we can get the upgraded set in a couple of years. This is really getting on my nerves, no one wants the direct to video sequels (Hello Disney?), so please stop shoving them down our throats. Carry over all(important)bonus material(games can be dropped)and PLEASE include both full screen and wide screen versions on the films that were shown that way in theaters(between 1961-1982)!If you want Lilo and Stitch looking and sounding its best buy the Blu Ray, but if you like bonus material you'll want to keep or pick up the 2 disc DVD.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61FFA%2Bh5gCL._SY300_.jpg

While this set isn't at a bargain price like the other two sets, it can be found less expensive if you look around.

Have they been remastered? .....probably not completely, but besides a little wear here and there, they are presented uncut and look pretty clear and not washed out.This set was release before the two Iwerks sets and it has the basic menu. The menu could have used a little work to make it a little more user friendly. You can play all the cartoons or look at the scene selection for individual titles, but once you start the cartoon from any point, it will play all from that point. Meaning you have to stop after each cartoon and go to the menu if you want to skip around and see selected shorts. It's not a huge deal, but it could have been easily fixed with a few adjustments.Is it worth buying, absolutely! it has 21 rare shorts that may never look any better or be released again.

Newer sets of the same release have the corrected disc intact, but if you happen to get an older stock set, you can have the corrected disc sent to you for free.Now that the set has all unedited cartoons, lets talk about what we get on this volume two release. First, we get 38 cartoons spread out on the two discs, 20 on disc 1 and 18 on disc 2. The cartoons look very colorful and clear, but there are scratches present, so a full restoration wasn't done. It really doesn't matter all that much as the cartoons look very good! It's just a little disheartening that MGM didn't feel these classic shorts were worth the extra trouble. Although the Cinemascope shorts included on this set look fantastic! I found that the audio was inconsistent from short to short, but none of them sounded muffled, just that some shorts were louder than others.I would like to address the complaints about the Whoopi Goldberg warnings, Please give me a break, if all I have to do is listen to a warning that is 30 seconds long, then I am fine with that, if you don't press menu skip and its all over. I just don't understand all the fuss, it's a new world and that is the way it is, so deal with it.The Tom and Jerry cartoons on this set are very good, but I didn't like them as much as on the first volume. It is obvious that the animation and music are top notch and I still consider these shorts classic, but I must admit after seeing so many cat and mouse cartoons in a short period was a little tough as the theme is almost always the same.The extras are a little thin on this set, but I suppose they ran out of material. I bought this set new for a little over $8.00 and it is one of the best bargains I've seen in a long time. I'm glad I waited until they corrected the errors and also reduced the price. For what you get here, it is a hard set to beat for fans of the famous duo!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5176PsApQrL._SY300_.jpg

Elfego Baca and The Swamp Fox Legendary Heroes are two lesser known series from Walt Disney's TV show, but are just as entertaining as any of the more popular series from the era. Once again the episodes on this set have had a proper restoration done to them or they were stored with extreme care. The first three episodes from each show are included here and I know that is bound to disappoint fans of the two series. While it would have been a better idea to give each series their own complete release, this could still be redeemed by releasing a second set with the remaining episodes for each series on it..... ala volume two. This would probably increase the sales of the first release for sure. The good new is the episodes that are included look remarkably good for their age. Like I mentioned in another Treasures release The Mickey Mouse Club, I was never a big fan of the show growing up during the 60's, but looking back at it now, I find it charming and fun.The first disc includes the first 3 episodes of Elfego Baca which is a fast paced &#34;shoot em up&#34; western series starring Robert Loggia (Frank from Scarface). The Swamp Fox is located on disc 2, While I had never heard of either of these shows, I found them both fun to watch and full of 50's action. Each episode is shown in its entirety with the Walt Disney intro making the episodes clock in at approx. 52 minutes. The extras on the first disc include an interview with Robert Loggia and 3 stills galleries.The second disc holds 3 (why not 4 ?) episodes from The Swamp Fox which look as good as the episodes from Elfego Baca on disc one. There is a lot of griping about how neither show has its complete run on this set, but I think Disney was skeptical of the popularity of the two series. Like I mentioned earlier in my review, this could be redeemed by releasing a volume two with the remaining 3 Baca and 5 Fox episodes on it. I'm sure this is a big reason why this set hasn't sold out....maybe if enough fans call or write Disney, they will answer the request with the remaining episodes for both shows released. Both series' episodes are in color with the intros in black and white as the original openings in color are lost.While both shows deserve their own release, there is no reason to rate this Treasures installment with a low rating. If the set had sold out they might have release the rest, but with such an underwhelming response, I doubt they will ever finish either series on DVD. Considering this was a WDT set that I knew little about, I came out of it very happy with this release and can only hope they will release the remaining episodes of both shows to complete the series(wave 10 please!). The discs are houses in their usual tin case with a reproduction of Disney art, a booklet and the COA.******I CALLED DISNEY AND REQUESTED FOR THE REMAINING EPISODE TO BE RELEASED. FANS OF THESE TWO SHOWS NEED TO CALL DISNEY 1800 723 4763 AND REQUEST FOR THE REMAINING EPISODES TO BE RELEASED ON A SECOND TREASURES VOLUME OR LIKE THE RECENT WALT AND EL GRUPO AND THE SHERMAN BROTHERS RELEASES.*******",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EHWQYPBML._SY300_.jpg

He is much more interesting if he can't control his changing into The Lizard and having a family gives the character complexity. 3) They don't utilize the fact that his web shooters are mechanical and even though they weren't organic in the comic books, I prefer that route in the live action films. 6) When uncle Ben dies, it isn't heartfelt and Peter doesn't show enough emotion about it.Toby McGuire may not have been the perfect wise cracker in the Raimi films, but he was engaging to watch when not in Spider Man mode. This was key to making a super hero film that was entertaining through out the entire film. (like Robert Downey as Iron Man).I know a lot of people complained about Spider Man taking his mask off all the time, but if you think about it that mask would have to be extremely uncomfortable and hot, so I think that is just a realistic observation by the filmmakers, but some times emotions are needed to be seen and you can't see expressions through the mask.The Amazing Spider Man is a very good film, but I won't watch it nearly as many times as the Raimi Spider Man films. It just isn't as much fun or as good. The Blu Ray has a very good transfer and some interesting bonus material, but nothing like the Raimi Spider man films received on their 2 disc DVD sets.Looking forward to seeing Spider Man 2 on opening day. :-DUpdate *** Went to see the 2nd film in this series and I was pretty disappointed.

A show about a recently widowed father and his young son. The chemistry between Bixby and Cruz are really what make this show such a treat. Of course the supporting cast is also good with Mrs. Livingston the Asian housekeeper, Uncle Norman and Tina two friends of the two. Even the dated late 60's theme doesn't hurt this show because the real values haven't changed or at least they shouldn't have.The show holds up surprisingly well and all 24 first season episodes are here on this four disc set. They look quite good too and it doesn't appear that anything is cut out as they run around 26 minutes each. The theme song is also unforgettable and is an important part of the lead in for each episode. Nilsson wrote and performs the catchy number and he adds variations of the theme throughout the episodes.Season2 is very good, but I personally like season 1 the best because I think the show works best when Eddie is younger, but that's not to say this season doesn't has some great episodes.If you've been looking for this show look no further as this is about as good as it's going to get.

Jaws is scary in its own right but a totally different type, the fear of what we know is really out there regardless of how they manipulate the facts.The Conjuring is creepy and quite possibly the best film about Exorcism since The Exorcist. That's a bold statement because I think the 1973 classic may be the scariest film of all time. The Conjuring has some really good scares and doesn't use tricks to get cheap ones either...or at least they seem warranted and used wisely.The acting is realistic with the characters reacting normally to these things going on.

For one, it was one of the few stop motion films that didn't feature Willis O'Brien or Ray Harryhausen at the helm. It also has one of my favorite endings in a giant monster film.Of course looking at it now it is obviously not O'Brien or Harryhausen's work. The effects are rather crude, but oddly memerizing at the same time. There seems to be mixed reviews on this release, but I found that these transfer are just fine. The films look great to good depending on the scene. The colors are bright, the image is clear in most spots, but there are some scratched and lines that pop up occasionally. Some of the outside shots in &#34;Beast&#34; are a bit fuzzy, but that can not be helped. It is the way these scenes were filmed.The thing to remember is these were very cheaply made films and regardless of scratches I doubt anyone has ever seen them  looking better.The Neanderthal Man is pretty much the same with the opening sequence looking the worst regarding scratches etc. This one is a real HOOT, with so much unintensional laughter my gut was busting.

Why all of the features on the impressive 2 disc DVD weren't carried over is a mystery, but par for the course for Disney so it seems.I own the 2 disc Special Edition DVD which is superior in a lot of ways, mostly the bonus material and the menus. The SD looks fine, but the Blu Ray is an improvement in that area.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51A6FK1CDFL._SY300_.jpg

Cars is an excellent film and visually it certainly shows the growth of the studio's animation. Unfortunately the film is a bit long for an animated film clocking in at close to 2 hours. The characters are all memorable, but for some reason this film does drag a bit at times. If it had been edited down to an hour and thirty five minutes it probably would have played better.It's still heads above the majority of the usual animated films and deserves a spot in any animation collector's library. The Blu Ray looks and sounds stunning and all the extras have been ported over from the DVD release in 1080P. We also get plenty of new additions to the bonuses exclusive to Blu Ray, if you've been holding off buying Cars, the Blu Ray will not disappoint.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YP4C-LjhL._SY300_.jpg

I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but he has impressed me in some of his films. 'The Last Samurai' just so happens to be one of those films! Cruise is excellent here and handles the lead role both physically and emotionally. Not since standing toe to toe with Dustin Hoffman in 'Rain Man' have I believed in one of his performances so whole heartedly.The film will certainly remind viewers of Costner's 'Dances with Wolvies' as it deals with a similar premise of a Civil War soldier's study of a foreign culture and total turn around of his preconceived opinion of it. I do think that 'Dances with Wolves' edges this one out, but it is a wonderful film all the same.The film is also beautiful to look with gorgeous scenery and breathtaking battles. The battle scenes are brutal, but never did I feel the graphic violence was gratuitous. There are a few tiny instances where I smelled Hollywood, but they are so tiny, I can't take away from this impressive film about honor and loyalty. It's just a beautiful film! The two disc DVD has a great transfer and lots of interesting goodies and I can not recommend this film or this edition enough.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EdSWs9r9L._SY300_.jpg

The story is very straightforward and the animation is really excellent even if the color palette is muted and dark, the design of the creatures is top notch with a haunting quality(one of Burton's signature attributes).9 is probably one of the best animated films in many years and while it was overshadowed by the likes of WALL E and UP, it isn't any less impressive.

Even though it took some getting used to Geddy's vocals, I always knew these guys could play their A $$'s off! There are probably only two groups left on the planet that I buy their new albums without hesitation one being The Rolling Stones and the other of course Rush. While the Stones haven't put out a great album in a long time, I still find their new offerings interesting.Rush on the other hand has delivered great album after great album, but even these musical giants have had their moments were they didn't top their last effort. For me I feel that the band continued to grow up to 'Hold Your Fire'. That doesn't mean that it's my favorite album, but there was a gradual climb to that point. When 'Presto' was released it marked the first time the band sounded like they went backwards...I know now that this was intentional. After 'Roll The Bones' the band started to dig in and really grow again with some of the newest albums technically amazing, but lacking in melody. I still love and own all of their albums and have nothing but the greatest respect for these stellar musicians and songwriters.I'm giving a little back history here because now with 'Rush Beyond The Lighted Stage' I get to hear what I've known for years from the guys who have influenced me and countless other musicians to play a little harder and I get to hear a lot of stuff that I didn't know about. While I and every other Rush fan would have liked this documentary to go on for hours, I think it is really well put together even though it should have been at least another 45 minutes longer.I can understand why this film is 106 minutes, but considering the fan base, I can't believe that the members of Rush didn't realize that Rush fans would want a much longer in depth look at the band's History. The early years are well done, but it seems to &#34;rush&#34; by the later years and even though the film is really quite good, I think with a little more effort, it could have been the definitive documentary all Rush fans were looking for.The Blu Ray has all of the extras that are on the two discs DVD, but to be honest, with all the early footage used in this piece, there is really little reason to buy the Blu Ray over the standard DVD as visual quality is really not all that much better. The small segments in HD will look fine on standard and the old stuff might even look a little better. If you don't own a Blu Ray player this is certainly not the reason to go and buy one.I rate the documentary itself 4 1/2 stars and the extras 5 stars for some very cool old concert footage with John Rutsey and other obscurities. Most of the other extras are mostly made up of segments that appear in the film as clips, are presented here more elaborately. If you love Rush(and I know you do!) this is a must own set",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C2YWY-6-L._SY300_.jpg

Michael Douglas even won an Oscar for his magnetic portrayal of the ruthless and unethical Gordon Gekko. Oliver Stone starts here with a decent idea, but the film lacks the style and conviction that made the original so great(in its time). There is too much time spent revisiting the past with an awkward cameo by Charlie Sheen and regurgitated dialogue from the first film. The uninspired script makes this one tedious for the most part and it makes this film seem too long. Even Gekko's speech seems like a flighty montage of the original.

The writing and performances are brilliant with absolutely flawless timing by all.  Watching the film on Blu Ray I was amazed how many lines I quote from this film,  there is at least one per scene.Dudley Moore plays the drunken Arthur to perfection making him fun and sympathetic rather than an obnoxious bore. John Gielgud is superb as Arthur's acid tongued butler who won an Oscar (and deservingly so) for his performance. Liza Minnelli's comic timing with Moore and Gielgud is priceless. Geraldine Fitzgerald and the rest of the cast are all in top form in this delightfully comedy. The new Blu Ray release isn't going to blow anyone away, but it looks better than it ever has on home video and probably better than it ever will. The same goes for the sound, this film never had a blistering soundtrack and the Blu Ray is simple and clear.Part of the problem is that films from the 80's seem to have a soft look to them to begin with. The film does look very good though and I think it's worth upgrading because the film is a classic. There are no extras, but we do get the disappointing sequel. Lightning was caught in a  bottle the first time and things would have been better off left alone.

His mind is &#34;prodigiously empty,&#34; according to another character (he always needs instructions), but his heart is in the right place; so it's a huge problem when he is mistaken for the Master/Builder who has to stop a villain from gluing the Universe together.We encounter several set pieces aimed at the adults who bring their offspring to the movie:* &#34;The Piece of Resistance&#34; (nope, the kiddies aren't going to get THAT one!) which is perpetually sought.* &#34;Honey, Where Are My Pants?&#34; is a supposedly hilarious television show that illustrates the emptiness of contemporary sitcoms.* The Good Cop/Bad Cop Lego who speedily swaps faces, depending on which cop he is playing.* The double-decker couch (?!) which is the best/worst original idea Emmet has ever offered.* The creative use of Legos to make a city, a desert, a pirate ship and that famous double-decker couch.* The Millennium Falcon makes an appearance late in the film.

It is now eternal winter. The people in the back end of the train are filthy, diseased, missing limbs and semi-starved. Any children they might have are taken from them.

Their aerial ballet had echoes of both Esther Williams and Busby Berkeley: You know, those dazzling kaleidoscopic effects.Our hero, Blu, lives with his lovely mate Jewel and their three offspring in Rio de Janeiro.

He wears a Pagliacci-type costume to cover the bald spot from his male pattern feather loss.* Gabi (Kristen Chenoweth) is a poisonous dart tree frog who sings everything from showtunes to opera.

I bought this DVD from Kino, which sells collectibles, but it may also be on Netflix or its equivalent, and I just found it here on Amazon! Yippee!Let's talk about it. When you were in grade school were you the bully-er or the bully-ee? Yeah, I know I made up both of those words, but you get the idea. Where in the bullying spectrum were you? Dishing it out? Taking it? Or a silent witness....This wonderful Swedish film (English captions) is about bullying in childhood and the scars that linger into adulthood. It is also about bigotry, provincialism, and shattered dreams. But WAIT! Before you shy away, let me add it is also about renewed hope, the healing power of love and the joy of community.My current heartthrob Michael Nyqvist (&#34;The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,&#34; etc...) is a celebrated orchestra conductor. He is, however, felled by a tricky heart which has forced him to an early retirement. Instead of resting on his laurels on the Mediterranean or a similar life of ease, he chooses instead, to return to his old hometown (the scene of his childhood misery), knowing that no one will recognize his new name, his new persona or his new attitude. He buys the abandoned grade school building and moves in.First thing he knows, the local pastor calls on him; he is given a complimentary bible and an invitation to be the church cantor. He apologizes and explains that he is only there to listen, not to get involved in music.Well, one thing leads to another...you know how these things go. And before you know it, we are acquainted with many of the small town personalities: the local bully and his battered wife, the punctilious preacher and his frustrated frau, the local slut, the town &#34;retard,&#34; the current choir mistress, the elderly singers, etc., etc., etc. By this time, I was smugly certain I had it all figured out, but I was wrong.Help yourself to a sm&ouml;rgsbord of unexpected pleasures.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VCJEYTXHL._SY300_.jpg

He's really dorky and his shy affection for Gwen is very effective.* Emma Stone (&#34;The Help&#34;) is Gwen Stacy, his steadfast girlfriend, in on his secret identity and smart as a whip; but we have to remember, Peter had promised her father he would stay away from her...* Jamie Foxx (&#34;Django Unchained&#34;) is Electro/Max Dillon, the nerdy guy everyone overlooks...even on his birthday.

From the Seminoles to the Senegalese, from the Mayan to the Malaysian, from the Inuit to the Egyptian, these are passed down through the ages with spooky similarities.As this movie began, it occurred to me that some of the kerfuffle from the fundamentalists might have been avoided if writer/director Darren Aronofsky had used something other than the Judeo-Christian version for inspiration. Then I realized he used the familiar names as a sort of shorthand to avoid the need for lengthy explanation. No matter what his rationale, by the time I left the theater, I felt I had been taken through all of Genesis (with generous doses of artistic license: the animals are computer generated images with only a slight tip of the hat toward realism). Do NOT trouble yourself with this film if you believe in a literal interpretation of the Judeo-Christian Bible.You see:* Russell Crowe (&#34;Winter's Tale&#34;) as Noah, the paterfamilias who gets one upsetting message after another from The Creator. He's doing his best to obey; it is clear that he is the world's first conservationist.* Jennifer Connelly (&#34;The Dilemma&#34;) as his wife Naameh, who seems part loving wife and mother, and part shaman (she paces through the ark swinging a sort of incense burner which anesthetizes the creatures).* Anthony Hopkins (&#34;RED 2&#34;) is Methuselah (see, I told you &#34;familiar names&#34;), sitting on his mountain, who wants to enjoy the taste of berries one more time.* Logan Lerman (&#34;Percy Jackson&#34; franchise) does some of the heavy lifting as Ham, who asks the obvious question, &#34;Where will I find a wife if all of mankind is wiped out?&#34;* Emma Watson (&#34;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34;) is Ila, their adopted daughter, gravely wounded when she was a child.* Douglas Booth (&#34;Romeo and Juliet&#34;) is Shem, the lucky son who gets the girl.* Ray Winstone (&#34;Hugo&#34;) is Tubal-Cain a descendant of Cain, perpetrator of the world's first fratricide. He says &#34;I am a Man&#34; and knows he has dominion over the animals.This PG-13 movie tries to cover too many issues and relies on computer generated imaging (rock warriors, anyone?) for all of the action. In my opinion, this only detracts from a fairly involving story, if only they had focused on it. Connelly, Crowe and Lehrman are all three very capable actors, so they brought more to the table than this script deserved.I saw this in a theater with closed captions. I suspect I would have missed some of the dialogue if I hadn't worn the glasses. There were some very quiet, murmured moments. I'm sure the DVD will have subtitles when Amazon releases it.",3.0,http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-site/icons/no-img-sm._V192198896_.gif

To me, this arcane modern-day gladiatorial frenzy emphasized (AGAIN!) that this is a slave auction: The bartering, the wheeling and dealing, the false leads, the rumors and the ridiculous behavior of the fan(atic)s, compounded by the utter helplessness of the players being shuffled around.Director Ivan Reitman (&#34;No Strings Attached&#34;) takes us inside the thought processes of a team manager whose decisions will dash many players' dreams, and rejuvenate others. This PG-13 script, written by first-timer Scott Rothman and Rajit Joseph (TV), makes it all too painfully clear that millions of dollars are spent promoting this mania.

She picks the worst time to spread her husband's ashes.* Chadwick Boseman (&#34;42&#34;) is one of those helpless hopefuls.

This is the kernel of the man who is destined to be the model of a humanized robotic law enforcement officer. This appealing actor is Swedish.* Gary Oldman (&#34;The Dark Knight&#34;) is the brilliant doctor/scientist who has developed a way to connect organic matter with metallic matter and create a robot with a human sensibility.

Cornish is Australian.* Samuel L. Jackson (&#34;Django Unchained&#34;) has a tongue-in-cheek blast as television personality Pat Novak.

All of the publicity material tells us that Ayrton Senna was a three-time World Champion Formula One race-car driver who died at age 34 (&#34;No fear. No limits. No equal.&#34;). What else can a documentary tell us?Three things stood out for me:1. Senna was from a well-to-do Brazilian family, so his storied career was well documented, from his trophy-winning go-kart days up to and including his death. His pit crew would hand him a Brazilian flag to wave during his victory lap, thus insuring his status as a beloved hero for millions of Brazilians.2. The arc of the relationship between Senna and his arch rival, Frenchman Alain Prost, also a three-time World Champion. These two highly competitive drivers started as rivals but became teammates. What happened after that, was unexpected.3. The problem the professional drivers had with bureaucratic oversight is also well documented. Racing officials arbitrarily removed many of the safety features from those high- performance cars over the drivers' strenuous objections. It took a martyr to prove their point.It is clear why Senna was so popular in Brazil. Not only was he a proud citizen, but he contributed millions to the poor and was a handsome, well-behaved young man. His victories were a source of great pride to his countrymen and his charities insured his reputation as a generous, almost saintly national icon.A Formula One driver has a camera mounted over his right shoulder, so we see the real thing!

Persistence pays (AND backing a highly acclaimed film). Thanks for all those reminders. Part of what makes this so convincing is the unfamiliarity of the faces, but the rest is excellent direction, wonderful acting and an unpredictable story.An elderly man is slowly sinking into the oblivion of Alzheimer's while his over-wrought son tries to provide care for him, hold a job, be an involved parent for his only child and, in his spare time, save his marriage. His wife has worked diligently to get visas so she, her husband and their daughter can leave Iran. The husband is adamantly opposed; he can't leave while his father (who no longer recognizes him) needs his help. The central issue is his father's disease and its disastrous effects on his family. It doesn't matter if we are in Tehran or Toledo, the ripple effects of Alzheimer's are the same.Here are the players:* Peyman Moadi (&#34;About Elly&#34;) Nader is dynamic, impatient, arbi- trary and loving. He cannot yield one iota, for fear he will lose everything. He feels his pride, his honor and his duty are in jeopardy, so nothing must interfere: not a wife, not a caretaker, not a daughter.* Leila Hatami (&#34;The Deserted Station&#34;) Simin is smart, deter- mined and organized; she is the wife who wants a better life else- where. Even though she can't say so out loud, she is stifled by her world and doesn't want her daughter to grow up in it.* Sareh Bayat (&#34;Devil's Take&#34;) Razieh is devout, obedient and desperate. She has been hired secretly (she is a woman) to care for the Alzheimer's patient. When he soils himself she has to call a Muslim help line to see if it is a sin for her to clean him up with no male in attendance.* Shahab Hosseini (&#34;Final Whistle&#34;) Hodjat is the furious husband of the caretaker; she failed to get his permission before going to work. His rage fuels the last half of this film.* Sarina Farhadi in her screen debut, is Termeh, the teenage daughter who is caught in the tug-of-war between her parents.I found the legal battles to be extremely interesting. All the parties convene in an office with what appears to be a magistrate. Each person presents his or her side of the story, amid interruptions and distractions from others, and the official tries to ascertain the truth. The part I really liked: NO LAWYERS! What an interesting concept.It is the caretaker's deeply held religious conviction that provides the turning point on which all the other issues hinge.

Together these pixies make the world's most inept team of babysitters.* Sharlto Copley (&#34;The A-Team&#34;) is Stefan, the young love who isn't true to Maleficent after all, in fact he betrays her on the most basic level: he cost her those wonderful wings. Aurora is his daughter.* Brenton Thwaites (&#34;The Signal&#34;) is Prince Phillip, who comes to save the day...or not... You've gotta see what happens! (Decon- struction of a well-known fairy tale can have its moments!)Parental Guidance is the key. Parents MUST know what to expect. Very few adults read anything about movies before they take their youngsters these days, so there may be some outrage and some traumatized kiddos. Oh well.... I tried....

This one is a dandy! Recommended by the Swedish branch of JayFlix, I finally got a look at it a couple of days ago.First of all, the cast:* Maggie Smith (&#34;Ladies in Lavender&#34; and &#34;Harry Potter&#34;) a just-paroled murderer, now hired as a housekeeper* Kristen Scott Thomas (&#34;The English Patient&#34; and &#34;The Horse Whisperer&#34;) a frustrated minister's wife* Rowan Atkinson (&#34;Four Weddings...&#34; and &#34;The Black Adder&#34;) the frustrating minister* Patrick Swayze (&#34;Dirty Dancing&#34; and &#34;Ghost&#34;) a smarmy golf pro* Tamsin Egerton (I think she's new) a gorgeous young actress who is the minister's precocious daughter!The minister's family lives next door to an annoying neighbor who has a constantly yapping dog, Clarence. The minister is such an excruciatingly boring speaker, his wife stays in bed; she can't bear to sit through his sermons any more. He is totally oblivious to the catastrophe looming in his own family. An elderly member of the congregation has a chronic problem with the flower arranging committee...AND she's snoopy! The daughter is not only beautiful, she's promiscuous. The son is bullied by his classmates simply because he is the minister's son. The golf pro is on the make...all the time...Enter Grace, the newly hired housekeeper. In no time at all, she assesses the situation and starts to rectify things. Watching her kick into action is a treat, even though you will probably recoil from some of her methods.I will emphasize: This is a BLACK comedy, but it's fun just the same. These are great actors who play characters who run true to form and you can't help but cheer them on. Just remember to suspend disbelief! (...and blood will tell...)I got my DVD from Amazon long before they started keeping track.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51rNkbJvPzL._SY300_.jpg

The more he talks with the OS, the smarter it gets. This unique and unpredictable film holds our attention from the very beginning.We see (and hear):* Joaquin Phoenix (&#34;Walk the Line&#34;) stars as Theodore, the mildly depressed fellow with the new operating system; he selects a female voice and names it &#34;Samantha.&#34; I've never seen Phoenix laugh so freely.* Amy Adams (&#34;Man of Steel&#34;) brings us Amy, a friend in his residential tower who is married to a control freak.* Rooney Mara (&#34;The Social Network&#34;) is his soon-to-be ex. All they have to do is sign the divorce papers but they have never discussed what went wrong.* Olivia Wilde (&#34;Butter&#34;) plays the charming blind date who doesn't want to be a flash in the pan. She would really like a relationship.* Scarlett Johansson (&#34;Don Jon&#34;) voices Samantha, the irresistibly sweet and funny OS, who becomes the light of his life.* Chris Pratt (&#34;Delivery Man&#34;) is Paul, totally happy to go on a double date, even though his friend Theodore is dating an operating system.This has been nominated for three Golden Globes, so let me add my own comments: the editing is brilliant. Subtle expressions which flit across Phoenix's face, reflect his reactions to Samantha's voice as she speaks. There are many long, long takes of just his face and voice reacting to Samantha. You will NOT be bored unless you have a hearing problem, in which case either go to a theater with closed captions or wait for the DVD. By the way, in another auditorium (same complex) the next day, I saw previews for this one and could hear every single word. Maybe it was the copy we saw at the screening. Hmmm....Shot in Shanghai and Los Angeles, augmented by some green screen work, this gives us a frightening peek at the not-too-distant future, with everyone totally involved with his or her hand-held electronic device; there is no human interaction on the street, in the train or at the desk.

After viewing this moving story, I can certainly see why. Director Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e (&#34;Young Victoria&#34;) pulled off nothing short of a miracle when funding suddenly dried up and he filmed this in 25 days. He fed his cast on over-loaded credit cards.Through the use of dates (when initially diagnosed in 1985, our hero is given 30 days to live), we know that this actually happened; it is a brilliant script by two newcomers, Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack, who used Ron Woodroof's life to inform their script (he's &#34;Woodruff&#34; in the film). Last year I saw the excellent documentary &#34;How to Fight a Plague&#34; and feel that the time lines and the learning curve about AIDS are realistic and factual.Some of this terrific cast are:* Matthew McConaughey (&#34;The Wolf of Wall Street&#34;) is Ron Woodruff, a macho rodeo cowboy and hustler. When told his diagnosis he lets the doctor know in no uncertain terms, what he thinks of THAT: &#34;Straight men don' get AIDS!&#34; Mr. M. lost 45 pounds to add realism to his role.* Jared Leto (&#34;Mr. Nobody&#34;) is Rayon, a transgender wannabe who partners with our hero to form the Buyers Club, a gimmick that (temporarily) circumvents Texas law. He lost 40 pounds as well as waxed his body for this role.* Jennifer Garner (&#34;Butter&#34;) plays Eve, a doctor who sees the value of reducing the toxic doses of AZT, despite her medical colleagues and Big Pharma. See how that works for her!* Denis O'Hare (&#34;J. Edgar&#34;) is Dr. Sevard, the face we soon come to see as evil because he represents the implacability of the ADA and Big Pharma.* Steve Zahn (&#34;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&#34;) is our hero's brother Tucker, a Dallas cop and an all-around good guy.* Griffin Dunne (&#34;Broken City&#34;) is Dr. Vass, an American doctor exiled to Mexico because of his unorthodox approach to HIV and AIDS. This proves to be a game changer.Ron Woodruff is a rake hell, so expect &#34;F&#34; bombs by the score, sexual situations (he didn't get AIDS sitting home watching TV), drug use and realistic depiction of dying victims. No wonder it is rated &#34;R&#34; and is awarded with wins and nominations! There isn't a weak performance; a tip of the Stetson to French-Canadian Monsieur Vall&eacute;e!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IXxLGbmVL._SY300_.jpg

And that is just the beginning of this twisty white-knuckle ride!We watch:* Liam Neeson (&#34;Taken 1 & 2&#34;) is our hero, a bit the worse for the wear, but a smart, resourceful agent, who can only watch as he is brilliantly framed.

This French (with English subtitles) movie is still in first-run houses, the release date for the DVD hasn't been announced. The director, Guillaume Canet, has been around for awhile, but I am not familiar with him or his work.On the other hand, Francois Cluzet (&#34;French Kiss&#34; and &#34;Ready to Wear&#34;), the wonderful actor who portrays a busy pediatrician, is a more familiar face, as is Kristin Scott Thomas (&#34;Four Weddings and a Funeral,&#34; &#34;The Horse Whisperer,&#34; and &#34;The English Patient&#34;) who has a principal role -- and speaks French fluently, as she is married to a Frenchman and lives there.Our story begins with the pediatrician and his much-loved wife on an outing at a lakeside cabin. After skinny dipping with him one night, she climbs out to go to their cabin, while he prepares to follow. She cries for help from the underbrush and he is brutally whacked on the head with a baseball bat. After three days in a coma, he awakens to discover that her corpse has been found, the victim of a serial killer.Eight years later, still single, he is quietly involved in his medical practice when he receives a mysterious e-mail advising him to &#34;tell no one&#34; about the attached video clip which is a film of a woman who appears to be his long-dead wife. Naturally he is vitally concerned and step by step we watch him become more and more deeply embroiled in a tangled web of lies, deception and violence.This film has NO wasted dialogue, NO unnecessary scenes, NO careless editing. It is exciting, involving and leaves no questions unanswered. It sweeps us along as our man, still in love with his long-deceased wife, tries with dogged determination and uncommon intelligence to untangle an eight-year-old (closed) murder case. His task is complicated by a Colombo-like police detective, played by Francois Berleand (&#34;The Transporter&#34; and &#34;The Chorus&#34;), who reopens the case and is convinced that our hero is somehow implicated.There are a number of plot twists but each makes sense and is consistent with the character of the person doing the twisting. There are a number of beautifully staged chase and street scenes that are brilliantly executed, along with high caliber acting every single minute. Cluzet's pediatrician is a person you WILL root for and this satisfying movie is one you will remember for a long time.I will watch for other movies by this director!

Well.... After seeing the stage productions of &#34;Jersey Boys&#34; many times (Seattle, Tampa, London and New York), this sets me up for a fall. This is a four-person biography with occasional songs which has been drawn from a stage musical. What we do NOT see is the musicality, the theatricality and the immediacy of the stage version. I wanted joyful exuberance.Bless Clint Eastwood for trying. He attended stage versions of this theatrical biography of &#34;Frankie Valle and the Four Seasons,&#34; aka &#34;Jersey Boys,&#34; which thrilled the professionals. He selected players from those versions, even though their characters' stories are diluted and stretched out in this 134 minute R-rated (language) ramble. What we see is hardscrabble beginnings, meteoric (ten long years) rise to fame, then the downside, which can best be done by a director who has first-hand experience.We have:* John Lloyd Young (&#34;Jersey Boys&#34; - 2006 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Broadway musical) as Frankie Valle, a young barber trainee who wants out of Jersey. He is bullied and dominated by a &#34;friend,&#34; Tommy DeVito, who is forming a musical group.* Vincent Piazza (&#34;Boardwalk Empire&#34;) as Tommy DeVito, who revels in his creation, changes the course of American musical history...and never lets anyone forget it! In MY opinion, this guy is a cocky, amoral sociopath, and too much screen time is wasted on his youthful crimes.* Erich Bergen (&#34;Jersey Boys&#34; Las Vegas cast) as Bob Gaudio, the brilliant songwriter who heard Valli and thought, &#34;I could write for THAT voice!&#34; (His parents wanted him to go to trade school.)* Michael Lomenda (&#34;Jersey Boys&#34;) as Nick Massi, the &#34;forgotten one&#34; (he's the Ringo of this quartet). He couldn't STAND being DeVito's roommate: &#34;The man is an ANIMAL!&#34;* Joseph Russo (&#34;It's Not You, It's Me&#34;) is Joe &#34;Joey&#34; Pesci. Yup, THAT Joe Pesci. He introduced Gaudio to Valli.* Christopher Walken (&#34;Seven Psychopaths&#34;) is Angelo &#34;Gyp&#34; DeCarlo, the mobster who hears Frankie sing &#34;My Mother's Eyes&#34; and is a loyal Valli fan from the get go.* Mike Doyle (Lots of TV) as producer Bob Crewe, a &#34;theatrical&#34; fellow who helps launch the group; he understands the business side of the music business.I take serious issue with the music. I hope the copy I saw was at fault, because the balance was waaaay off and the horn section was simply a cacophony which ruined &#34;You're Just Too Good To Be True.&#34; Other selections were off balance, badly mixed and too stylized; most songs become stylized after they have been hits for awhile. &#34;Who Wears Short Shorts&#34; was so stylized in the early scenes, I wouldn't have recognized it if I hadn't known it was there. (Bob Gaudio wrote his first hit song when he was 15 years old, but this isn't mentioned here; he was inducted into the Songwriters' Hall of Fame in 1995.)BTW, I purchased the book &#34;Places Please&#34; by Daniel Robert Sullivan which is based on his torturous journey to play Tommy DeVito in the Toronto show. It is a great insider's look at the demands made on performers who desperately want to be cast; it describes the hard work and the meticulous choreography involved in the stage versions of &#34;Jersey Boys.&#34;If you haven't been spoiled by the stage version, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy this interesting story, interspersed with well-known songs that are part of the fabric of our lives. If you've seen and loved the stage version, maybe not so much...I'll get the DVD from Amazon because I so love the story, but I don't understand how this happened... Eastwood is a musician! ...sigh....",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41plzir7BQL._SY300_.jpg

Merriam-Webster DictionaryNow my review: Have you ever been told you have a doppelg&auml;nger (someone who looks exactly like you)? I have.... But I have never been motivated to investigate, unlike our hero in this chaotic Mystery/Thriller, where we see a glum history professor become fixated on meeting his dynamic double after he spots him in a movie.Based on the novel by the late Jos&eacute; Saramago and directed by Canadian Denis Villeneuve (&#34;Prisoners&#34;), our R-rated story has nudity, sweaty bodies and a car crash, but no gunshots, blowie uppie stuff or much profanity.Here are some of the cast members:* Jake Gyllenhaal (&#34;Prisoners&#34;) is both the professor and the actor. Give this guy some points: his physical bearing is very different, based on which character he is playing. I was impressed.* M&eacute;lanie Lauren (&#34;Inglorious Basterds&#34;) is the professor's girlfriend, far more patient with his moods than I would expect.* Sarah Gadon (Lots of TV) is the actor's porcelain-skinned, very pregnant wife. She seems uncommonly smart.* Isabella Rossellini (&#34;Infamous&#34;) may or may not be the professor's real mother.Shot back-to-back with the filming of &#34;Prisoners&#34; this pretentious work of &#34;Art&#34; was off-putting to me from the beginning. It had gloomy lighting and mystifying relationships, plus unexplained weeping. These were compounded by two unlikable characters, each with an identical scar on his torso...which is never explained.The music, photography and production design all send portentous signals that all is not as it seems, particularly when the spider theme keeps showing up.

Well, in this movie scientists change him into a big manly man because he respects strength, unlike guys who have always been strong. We see that our hero may be scrawny, but he's brave, patriotic and tenacious..the very traits those scientists are looking for.It's a challenge to find a politically correct villain, so Nazis, lacking their own anti-defamation league, are a handy target for this Marvel Comics- based 3D CGI fest. Get ready for storm troopers, vintage warfare, Stealth bombers (?!) and LOTS of blowie uppie stuff.Let's look at the troops:* Chris Evans (&#34;The Nanny Diaries&#34; the Harvard Hottie) seems so darned LIKABLE! He is a perfect Captain America, object of derision, exploitation and ultimately, adulation.* Hayley Atwell (&#34;The Duchess&#34; the Other Woman) can run with WWII troops and shoot a machine gun without wearing a helmet, which would muss her hair.* Tommy Lee Jones (&#34;The Company Men&#34; the crabby guy) is a skeptical Army top kick with all the funny lines.* Stanley Tucci (&#34;Burlesque&#34; Cher's loyal sidekick) is the wise scientist who selects our 97-pound weakling.* Derek Luke (&#34;Antwone Fisher&#34; he was Antwone) is one of our hero's loyal cadre of troopers.* Samuel L. Jackson (&#34;Thor&#34; he was the surprise cameo at the end) is once again the surprise cameo at the end.* Dominic Cooper (&#34;Mamma Mia!&#34; he was the callow bridegroom) his character founded Stark Enterprises: he's Iron Man's father!* Hugo Weaving (&#34;The Matrix&#34; the villain) is, once again, a dastardly power monger who even out-Hitlers Hitler.* Toby Jones (&#34;Infamous&#34; he was Truman Capote) is the villain's toady.I was impressed by the seamless CGI integration of our hero's head on a puny adolescent body at the beginning of the film. The story is involving but not complicated; the language is PG-13 and often funny; there are no sweaty bodies or car chases; but I only ducked once, so to me, the 3D is optional.I enjoy seeing characters from other Marvel Comics who appear here, and the final scene is a blatant setup for the next chapter of this fledgling franchise.

Because the humor was character driven rather than derived from punch lines or insults, we credit the writer, Ehren Kruger, who specializes in action and suspense (&#34;The Ring 1 &amp; 2&#34; and &#34;Transformers 1 &amp; 2&#34;). Because the action has a LOT of blowie uppie stuff, we credit the director, Michael (&#34;Bang! Bang!&#34;) Bay, who has made a highly successful career out of second-rate, mindless action flicks.Of course this is absolutely loaded with Computer Generated Imaging, but luckily it has a generous amount of closeups with human beings dealing with human issues: e.g., a father who realizes his 17-year-old daughter has a REAL boyfriend; an inventor having trouble paying ordinary bills; a patriot who fiercely clings to his beliefs even after all evidence shows he has made a tragic mistake. Nothing really new here, but packaged nicely.We see:* Mark Wahlberg (&#34;Lone Survivor&#34;) Father of a teenage girl, this character has a talent for inventions but lacks business sense. He borrows some money to buy a trashed semi truck then discovers holes in the radiator from anti-tank missiles. Suddenly his lonely farm is teeming with cop cars and black SUVs, because SOMEONE wants it. Our story begins...* Nicola Peltz (&#34;Bates Motel&#34;) is that (usually) obedient daughter who has landed a special date for the prom. She is exasperated by her father's careless treatment of money, but works with him on his inventions...AFTER she has finished her homework.* Jack Reynor (&#34;Delivery Man&#34;) When he and that protective father are cornered by Decepticons, he yells,&#34;We're not doing this to save your daughter, we're doing it to save my girlfriend!&#34;* Stanley Tucci (&#34;Hunger Games&#34;) has developed a new generation of transformers which will make Optimus Prime and his ilk obsolete.* Kelsey Grammer (&#34;Partners&#34;) and his right-hand man Titus Welliver (&#34;Argo&#34;) make us hate mankind.It was fun watching Tucci and Wahlberg schlep that absurd nuclear device (Yes, that's what I said!) all over Hong Kong as a battle royal rages around them. It was refreshing to see the loyal daughter turn and wade back into the fray because her father had been left behind.Two scenes had me convinced I suffer from acrophobia: the first is a high-wire bit as our heroes attempt to flee on cables stretched high over the city. The second was a parcour-style chase scene on the balconies and ledges of a Hong Kong tenement. Both had me holding my breath. I never thought I'd say it, but: Good job, Mr. B.
