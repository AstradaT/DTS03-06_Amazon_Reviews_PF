Applying to seems inside the tent while set up, is looking up and back which is very uncomfortable after a long period which is required to get it done correctly. If it had been thinner it would have been much easier but it would drip. Spreading it out is like working with clear silicone just before it sets. Kind of a panic situation and very tedious. Have to get it spread out before its unworkable. If it starts to get stiff before you get it spread out correctly then it looks bad.

Overall I do like this gun, and it is very nice for target shooting and plinking.  It could definitely handle pest control, but considering it is a single shot, multi pump gun, I think you'd only get one chance to take out said pest.Now, as I said, there is a lot of plastic on this gun.  The barrel and structural components are metal, but nearly all else is plastic.  Of prime concern is the bolt lever, which is a very flexible plastic.  I am concerned that the bolt lever is going to break after a while, since I do shoot this gun regularly.  That aside, the plastic does keep the weight down, and this gun is very easy to pump (for me anyway, I'm no Hercules, but I'm not weak either), so I don't have any issues with shooting this gun for long periods of time.The scope and pellets than comes with this gun is garbage, my scope barely fit properly on the gun, and it was so far out that I maxed out the windage dial trying to zero it, but it wasn't even close to zero.  I went to Walmart and found a Crosman scope that looked identical to the included scope, and the Crosman scope fit and zeroed properly.  The Crosman scope was $7.52, so it was well worth it.With a decent scope finally mounted, I found that this gun is accurate, consistent, and the most powerful pump action airgun I have ever shot.  It only takes about 6 pumps to activate the heavy targets on my Caldwell auto reset airgun target, ten pumps just flings the targets right up.  As I said before, this gun's power and accuracy is definitely up to the task of taking out a pest, although you'll likely only get one attempt.  This gun is a touch louder than other pumper airguns I have shot, but it's not very loud still.Time will tell if I am right about the durability of this gun, I hope it proves me wrong and nothing breaks.  I will try to update this review later on to say if it is still functional or not.  But at this time, I will happily recommend this as a target shooter, for plinking and/or pest control.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31hKFPZENDL._SX300_.jpg

I put up with this flaw for about a week, until one day I decided to look into it when I was outside shooting.While looking into the space where the mag is inserted and watching the breech as I cocked the gun, a sharp edge on the gun's plastic nicked one of my fingers, which startled me and caused me to drop the gun about four feet onto my rock driveway.The gun literally broke in half......the trigger guard broke off, and the butt broke off just behind the magazine slot.  I haven't dropped my Marines airsoft rifle, but I have tossed it around and bumped it around several times, and it still works.In short, if you're looking for a cheap springer rifle, don't get this, get the Marines airsoft spring rifle.  It's more accurate and more durable, and while it doesn't have as many immediate rounds (the Marines rifle has 18 rounds, this has 45), the mag on the Marines rifle has a capacity of approximately 300 BBs, and I feel the rear peep sight is much, much nicer on the Marines airsoft rifle.",1.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ntcH8GP%2BL._SX300_.jpg

I take a few boxes (leftovers from Amazon orders) outside and pepper them with this gun.  When I'm feeling more conservative, I switch to semi-auto mode, and shoot my gel targets in my basement.  I am currently using .2g BBs, and they do drift at a certain range.  So I have some .25g BBs on the way.

I have also purchased aThompson King Arms Full Metal Airsoft Electric Gun, Brown/Black, and while I like that gun better, I will keep and continue to use this one.  Since I find this to be more accurate with .25g BBs, I may put a scope on this rifle, which give it an advantage over the Thompson, which has no rails and thus can only use the included iron sights.

Well, I ran four C02's through it (used twice, as it takes two C02's) and I am already sending it back to Amazon (yet another kudos to their awesome return policy!).The gun worked fine on the first group of C02's, until the C02's began to weaken, then I noticed that the gun would only fire in burst mode, even if I had the selector switch on semi auto mode.  Also, I noticed that it went through the C02's very rapidly, and this gun does not have a blowback, and there were no leaks from the C02 capsules.I loaded another set of C02's, and the gun wouldn't even fire, it would just spit the BB's out.  And it still would only fire in bursts, despite being in single shot, semi auto mode.So, I wouldn't recommend getting this gun at all.  Umarex does make some nice airguns and airsoft guns, as evidenced by my Fusion rifle, but this is not one of them.  It's a pity that these guns aren't well designed and made, as this is the only automatic airgun that fires steel BB's, all others fire plastic airsoft BB's.

The ammo capacity is about on par with the Stinger P311, and while this gun doesn't have the power, it is very pretty.  I got the silver one, and it looks better in person than it does in the stock photo.I will keep this pistol, because it seems well made and reliable, but I'm just going to stick with shooting it at my gel targets at close range, it doesn't have enough power for me to plink with it at anything else.  It just knocks over plastic army men and plastic animals, it can't penetrate cardboard unless fired at point blank range, and even then, it just embeds the BB into the cardboard,  I might try it on my metal spnner target; perhaps it's low power will keep it from ricocheting BBs.This gun's hop up is too much, BBs curve way up.  I think UTG did that intending to increase the gun's range.  While it may do that, it's low power means that it'll hardly do anything at range.  Also, the front sight is just a small nub at the end of the barrel, very irritating to use because of it's small size.If you want more power, check out the Crosman Stinger P311 or the Taurus PT 24/7.

The material is very strong and yet incredibly cool in hot weather.  I really love that the shirt is long enough to tuck deep into pants so it never rides up and out.  I got the V-neck and I'm glad I did because it's cooler and fits really well.  There was no chaffing or itchiness on the skin in any area even after all day carry.  The gun area is well cushioned for all day carry.  Most importantly it does a superior job concealing your firearm by also holding it snug to your body.  It is ideal for a snub nose or small auto.The larger handguns don't work as well and I'm being honest.  I tried my .45ACP and while it will work, it's best to stick with smaller weapons.  There are actually two pockets on each side that can hold a firearm.  It fits my S&W; Bodyguard .38spl. perfectly.  If you own a snub nose or small auto you are going to want this shirt!  You can carry a weapon on either or both sides with an additional pocket on each side for cuffs, ammo, IPod, etc.  The rearward gun pockets have a retention strap for the weapons which I found unnecessary so I removed them on the three shirts I own (two white and one black).

After realizing that and comparing the two, it's a coin toss now. I found the EDC model in a store and was able to better compare. This one is a heavier material which was noticeable, but am suspecting that once is gets broke in more it will be no big deal. Just like new shoes - they always feel stiff at first. Though mentioned a weight difference I don't think a few ounces is going to break one's back. Other differences: this one has a grommet hole under the pocket for the water bottle whereas the EDC it's under the main compartment. This one makes more sense. From the front the right pocket is shorter having 2 Molle straps as opposed to 3 on the EDC. Being shorter the pocket is shorter, but has another behind it, which I like. On the right webbing where the shoulder straps meets the padding 1 Molle strap and no Velcro, but the EDC has Velcro. The left side there are 2 Molle straps I like this arrangement. On the front top pocket there is Velcro measuring about 2&#34; x 6&#34;. This seems more functional to me. These are little differences and the main components are essentially the same. The EDC I think is a bit smaller overall - best to check. On the Maxpedition site you can find product videos for both and are worth watching. If you get this one, you'll need 3&#34; Molle speed clips like that from Blackhawk, but 5&#34; for the EDC. Both are well made and had I got the one I originally had in mind I would have kept it like I will with this one.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51IGtBnQU8L._SY300_.jpg

Didn't quite like the SCH27 and did more research this time around.  This knife is huge, solid, with a hard, rubberlike handles.  Blade is coated with a grey, The sheath comes with little pocket for firesteel/flint/sharpening stone/whatever.  Blade is very thick and should be ok for outdoor tasks. Will update when I use.  The knife has a great heft; you really should find a store carrying this knife and try it out.Only issue I had was the handles didn't quite line up with the tang--so I loosened/realigned them.  Fit perfect with that adjustment.  Would recommend for those looking for huge knife at a decent price.**Update**Bought another one of these; Quality control was much better--handles fit perfectly out of the box.  Very happy!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414eWbWpV0L._SX300_.jpg

The extension will give you more confidence when drawing the pistol from a holster or pants pocket, as you can hook the little finger around it.  Also, the lip provides a purchase point should you carry the 5-round magazine for a spare (or two, as I do), as the magazine fits low in a magazine carrier. I don't use the extension when shooting, but it does add a finishing touch to the pistol.WARNING!The magazine spring is under extreme tension. Ensure that you have your face away from the magazine base during replacement.  The XDs magazine does not have a provision (as in some magazines) to capture the floor plate. You can be injured if your are not keeping constant pressure on the magazine floor plate.  At the minimum, parts can go flying and if Murphy's Law is working, you may never find them. You will then have a XDs magazine repair kit on your hands, minus whatever parts that you can't find.The magazine extension is well made and fits the XDs45 magazine snugly = very snugly.Slide the magazine extension onto the magazine while holding the magazine locking plate down to allow the extension to slide over the locking pin.  At this point, you can release the magazine locking plate.  Continue to push the magazine onto the magazine.  The magazine will click into place.  Load the magazine to capacity to ensure that the magazine base is fully seated and that the magazine locking plate pin is firmly in place.A Word to the wise: Should you, as I did, lose the magazine locking plate due to components flying through the air with the greatest of ease, it will not be replaced by Springfield, as they do not offer any magazine parts with the exception of the spring.  Resign yourself, as I did, to purchase a new (and whole) magazine and relegate the (now unserviceable) disassembled magazine to the \magazine repair parts' bin.I normally do a 6' drop test into a cardboard box to ensure that the magazine will not come apart when dropped on the ground.The magazine extension does not seem to interfere with concealment.""",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ewlDVtiHL._SY300_.jpg

Mounted atop a UTG 0.5-inch, three-slot riser (#RS05S3), the sight allows me to quickly remove it by using the lever, should it fail (which it has not), and use the iron sights. When mounted, I can co-witness the rear UTG low profile rear sight.The tube is 40mm, which allows a wider field of view than most dot &#34;tube&#34; sightsThe dot (green or red) is surrounded by a 4-point segmented circle that aids the eye in focusing on the dot. With the unit that I received, the segments are slightly out of perfect vertical and horizontal alignment but it is very slight and does not interfere with its purpose.The on/off switch provides variable adjustment of dot intensity. In fact, the lowest setting may seem too bright to some users in low light but it more than adequate for daylight. The unit uses a standard CR3032 battery (included) that lies under the cap of the Illumination Adjustment Knob.An Allen wrench is provided that allows for tightening/loosening the quick detachment lever tension. Elevation and windage knob caps are easily removed for accessing the adjustments.The unit is well-made, comes with flip lens covers, and is priced right for the budget-minded.
