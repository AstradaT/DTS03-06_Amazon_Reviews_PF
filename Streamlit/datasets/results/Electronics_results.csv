It saved us the several hundred dollars that we would have spent on a Bluetooth capable home theater receiver, and provides us the same functionality through our current receiver.With this device we can easily and seamlessly stream music and other audio from our Apple iPod Touch, Nexus 5, Nexus 7, Bluetooth enabled laptop, or any other Bluetooth source through our existing sound system.  It only took a few minutes to set up and works very well.  It sounds great and connects from anywhere in our living room.  It even stays connected when you take the phone into another room.We recommend this Bluetooth adapter for anyone trying to modernize your older receiver without spending a ton of money replacing it.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BBpCgpNML._SX300_.jpg

It is a good material for preventing it from falling off your dashboard of your car, but not so good if you want to easily slide your phone into and out of your back pocket.Other than that one complaint, this is a great case.

I confess, this review will barely scrape the surface of this incredible product, but I'll do my best:To start, there are 8 Main Applications, 10,000 clipart and digital images, 2000 high-resolution digital photographs, 350 professionally designed templates, 2000 vehicle templates, 800 frames an patterns, and more than 5 hours of training videos, including 1.5 hours of new content available for downloading.The main applications are:CoreblDRAW X7, for Vector illusion and page layoutCorel Photo Paint X7, for imaging editingCorel PowerTRACE X7 for Bitmap-to-vector tracingCorel CONNECT  X7 for Content finderCorel CAPTURE X7 for Screen captureCorel Website Creator for website designPhoto Zoom Pro 3 for Photo enlarging o digital imagesConcept Share for online collaboration toolTrying to learn all of this has been impossible in the allotted time.  What I have been able to put to use (mostly the applications for photography) has been exciting.  They run on my 64 bit, Windows 8, with 3.3 MHz  AMD processor, and 8GB or RAM.  And they run at super speed.But lets get real.  This product is for professional image artists, not for armatures like me.  Sure, I now have a lot more tools to grow artistically, and the graphic are out of thus world,but I'll never make it as a pro.  Lucky for me that that I got this through the Amazon Vine,  I could never have justified the expense.  I can only recommend this to real professional artists, and serious wannabes.

And my case for the Kindle has room enough for the ultra thin keyboard which is held on by magnets.  So now I can carry one or both in their individuals cases and run either tablet, or both of them on the same keypad.  That's pretty  S W E E T..The Dell venue Pro has a little problem with accidental multiple characters from screen input.  The Keypad greatly reduces that problem.  .

Before I received the drive, I called OWC to see if they would price match, and the answer was no. So, I thought Shame on Me. OWC's pricing was $449. for a bare drive and $475. for one that included tools and an enclosure for the old SSD. (OWC's pricing has since been reduced to $398. and $419. respectively) I opted for the bare drive. I installed the drive, and as others have noticed, the vertical dimension of the circuit board the components are mounted on is a millimeter or 2 larger than the stock SSD. Others have cut the board, I didn't, I applied a little pressure and it snapped into place. OWCs installation video is, IMO, far better than the Transcend video. Once set up, the SSD seemed to work fine, for awhile, but less than a day later, the drive started giving me problems. I tried repairing it with both Disk utility and Tech Tool Pro, both to no avail. Two days later it happened again. I called OWC and asked for an RMA. They agreed but said I would have to pay a restocking fee and pay for return shipment. I challenged that, saying this was not a capricious return, that the unit was defective and I expected OWC to pay for shipping and refund the full amount. They agreed, and sent me a UPS label.When ordering the Transcend JetDrive I was quoted a delivery time of from 2 to 4 weeks. The unit was shipped 3 days after the order was placed and I received it one day later, that's 4 days after order placement! The price of the JetDrive 480 GB SSD from Amazon was $350. + Sales Tax (OWC charges no tax in Arizona). If I could have waited longer, I could have bought it from my memory Supplier, Data Memory Systems and not paid Sales Tax, but Transcend has not yet supplied it's distributers with this product.Upon receipt of the JetDrive, yesterday, the first thing that jumped out at me was the packaging. The OWC SSD came packed in an anti-static bag enclosed in a thin gauge blister packed piece of cardboard with blue printing. It looked the packaging used by Ace Combs. The Transcend packaging on the other hand was impressive. A heavy gauge white slide out box with a full color picture of the SSD. The box was multi layered and contained the drive, the enclosure for the OEM drive, and the tools necessary for installation. Each layer was a plastic bed with depressions sized to fit the associated parts. It also contained an instruction booklet and warranty information. The instructions are, IMHO, inadequate, and only two pages apply, the other 26 pages being written for other languages.The tools worked very well, and installation was a breeze. the form factor of the circuit board is the same as apple's so no undue pressure was needed for installation. My old SSD fit into the supplied enclosure with no issues.I then cloned the JetDrive using Tech Tool Pro from the external Hybrid Drive I had been using as the main drive for my MBA. I foolishly ordered my MBA with only the 64GB SSD.No issues. Everything is working as expected. In terms of speed. I have not measured the speed, but it feels very snappy. I believe the OWC and Transcend drives to be equal here. Transcend even supplies software to enable Apple's Trim support, OWC does not. There is however, third party software that enables Trim, Trim Enabler. I use that anyway for the SSD I use in my Mac Pro.The Transcend drive seems to run color than true OWC drive. When feeling the bottom of my MBA where the SSD is mounted, the area while warm, is not as warm as it was with the OWC unit.In ending, I would urge anyone installing the JetDrive in a MBA to watch the OWC installation video, again, it is superior to the Transcend video, and will make things more understandable to you.The JetDrive is by far the superior product, and as of right now is $69. cheaper than the OWC Aura Pro. When I bought the OWC product, it would have cost $125 more than the corresponding Transcend product.That IMHO is Value.Currently, Apple charges $500. to go from a 128GB SSD to a 512GB SSD in the MBA. So, $350. for a 480GB SSD AND you get to keep your old drive, you can't beat that.The Transcend drive seems to run color than true OWC drive. When feeling the bottom of my MBA where the SSD is mounted, the area while warm, is not as warm as it was with the OWC unit.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LcEqa60cL._SY300_.jpg

I inherited an older Firewire Fantom from my brother when he passed away 2 years ago.  This drive replaced a dying LaCie USB 2.0 drive.  I am using the drive as a backup drive so the drive speed really isn't that important to me.  It does however communicate with the Intateck Card, and it is recognized by the Mac's OS as a USB 3.0 device.  So far it's been working as designed.My reasons for giving it only three stars are:1.  Fantom gives no specifications for the drive, other than capacity.  I don't know the spindle speed, the amount of cache, the number of platters or the OEM for the drive.  MicroNet (Fantom's parent company) disguises the origin of the drive and lists themselves as the manufacturer.  MicroNet is not a drive manufacturer, they buy the bare drive and repackage it into their enclosure.  I could open up the enclosure and check, but then I would void the warranty.2.  The instructions that come with the drive and the instructions available as a PDF online are quite old and out of date as far as the Macintosh is concerned.  It is also out of date for Windoze.  No mention is made of Windoze 8.3,  The Transformer power cable does not snap into place into the case's receptacle.  Retention of the power cable is very poor and care must be taken so it doesn't slip out while in use.Hopefully this drive will prove to be reliable.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Sba4yuL3L._SY300_.jpg

I am unlucky enough to have one.  There is a serious problem with battery swelling that the manufacturer is not willing to accept responsibility for.  The battery is located in a nacelle so when it does swell, it is impossible to remove.  I tried taking the unit apart in an effort to remove the battery without success.  I then searched the web and found many instances of battery swelling.  It appears that in some instances Logitech has replaced the units and in other cases, has not.  I don't know the logic behind their thinking.  In any case I am contemplating legal action.  I have been a Logic customer for years having owned three Harmony remotes and currently use a Logitech Keyboard and Wireless Mouse with my Macintosh.This battery swelling issue is a serious problem and could pose a fire danger.  I discovered my unit severely overheating and the display had developed large black blotches while the remote was lying in it's charging cradle, I tried to pick it up, and it was to hot to hold.  This is clearly not a safe condition.I have talked to Logitech Customer Support on two occasions, written them two eMail messages and posted to their company web site.  They have refused to replace my unit and on the second call offered me a 35% refund on a current unit.  They have not responded to my eMail messages.Clearly this is not a company with any kind of customer respect and it is not a company I will do business with in the future.",1.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vItcfUM4L._SY300_.jpg

At first Logitech refused to replace, but I was persistent and it paid off.My review follows:I have only had this unit for a few days, but so far I like it.  It's a completely different concept than their old remotes.  The software is new, and you program for your area and you service provider.  So far so good.My first issue was, my zip code.  About 4 years ago, the USPS, in it's infinite wisdom changed my zip code.  Four years later, Logitech hasn't yet caught up.  When I entered my zip code, nothing.  Then, on a whim, I entered my old zip code, one that doesn't exist anymore, and bingo, it was recognized.The programming from there was tedious but pretty easy.  Te remote allows you to select up to 50 of your favorite channels, and you chose them from a touch screen using icons that identify the channel and also shows the channel number.  You can also arrange these icons in any order you want.  The icons are small, and some are hard to read.  What this means to me is, that I no longer have to use DirectTVs Channel Guide to locate the channel number, and then enter that on a keypad on the remote.  I simply scroll on the touch screen until I find the channel I want and tap.  The remote has made a few mistakes, but generally it's pretty good and choosing the correct channel.  It does save time.  There is also the option of a numeric touch screen for those instances where you want to enter a numeric number.  I don't think I will be using the numeric key pad much.  Also, during the programming, there was an instance where Logitech's software hadn't picked up the complete channel lineup, but there is a provision that allowed me to manually enter it, albeit with a generic icon.  So far it works for me.As a final thought, as I mentioned earlier, this was a replacement for a Harmony One that had a swelled battery and had become dangerious to use because of excessive heat coming from the remote.  The battery in the Harmony One is in a nacelle and once it starts to swell, it's impossible to remove, I know I tried.  I also have a Harmony 880, that battery had also started to swell, but the battery is mounted in a conventional way, and it was easily changed.  I guess Logitech is worried about this going forward, because the battery in the Ultimate One is NOT, that's right, is NOT replaceable.  The instructions say that when the unit reached end of life????  Who knows when that is???  You dismantle (destroy) the unit and remove the battery for disposal.I don't believe this is the proper solution on an electrical item that has a list price of $250.00.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EVxhoieBL._SY300_.jpg

The last Mac Pro Tower before the latest Black Can Mac Pro.  Overall I luv the machine.As some of you Macintosh folks know USB 3.0 and the Macintosh Internal Bluetooth module can interfere with each other.I installed the Inateck 4 Ports PCI-E to USB 3.0 Expansion Card for Mac Pro in February of this year.  Then the fun began, There was much interference between the card and the Apple Bluetooth module.  I tried many so called fixes, and nothing worked.My only Bluetooth device is a Microsoft Laser Mouse 8000, which I dearly luv.  If I installed a USB 3.0 device into the inateck card, I would lose the Bluetooth connection.  With just the card installed, the mouse operation was very erratic.  It was terrible to work with.  I added a powered 7 port Pluggable USB 3.0 Hub to the card, and I could plug USB 3.0 devices into that and not lose the Bluetooth connection, but the mouse operation was still erratic, terribly erratic.I scoured Amazon for Bluetooth dongles (adapters) and found two that said they were Macintosh compatible.  The first one I tried was the Rocketek.  The Macintosh recognized it, but I could not get it to pair with the Microsoft Mouse.I then tried the second one, the Kinivo.  I used Apple's Bluetooth Explorer Utility, chose the device, and tried to pair it with the Microsoft Mouse, and Bingo - SUCCESS!!!!!My Saga is over.  The darn thing works.

My mistake. There are (5) ports, but you have to use (1) to connect a Cat5 cable line between a port on your router and this switch. (I  thought there was going to be a port on the back or side of the product to connect - leaving 5 usable ports.On the switch is a power jack for the included AC adapter (found on the side of the switch) and the 5 ports. Some lights on the top of the switch let you know they are active (blinking) or powered (steady green light).The directions were minimal, and really didn't tell you much of anything. You can look at the photo on the box to see how it works, but I wondered if the line between the router and the switch needed to be in any specific port. I assumed #1 - and it works.The build quality is lightweight, but then again, there's not much 'hardware' to weigh it down.  I wanted to mount it on the wall so I used Velcro strips, which worked fine for this purpose.TIP: I use colored Cat5 cables to help me identify what's connected to my router, as well as this item:Dotz Dotz Cord Identifier Kit, Clear, 12 Regular/12 Jumbo, With Inserts/Stickersand aBrother P-touch Home and Office Labeler (PT-D200)for the larger AC plugs. Some may not need to do this, but for me, this really helps!NOTE: This is not a 'gigabit' switch that would be ideal for streaming media.

Unfortunately it won't help very much in terms of speed, as the processor and cache are also part of the equation.  It will help somewhat with freeze-up problems which you may encounter with only 4GB installed.It does have a media card reader, webcam and HDMI and VGA ports.  Three USB 2.0 ports are nice, but no USB 3.0 (the newest, faster standard) was disappointing, especially since it does have a HDMI port.  The keyboard is full sized, and responsive.There is both a Ethernet port (wired Internet) and Wifi adapter installed.  NO Bluetooth, but you can buy a Bluetooth adapter like this:Kinivo BTD-400 Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter - For Windows 8 / Windows 7 / Vistawhich fits in a USB port and works very well.  They are about ten dollars.This PC is one I'd select if the price was low enough to give to my step-dad as a gift.  This is a guy who uses Google to search and Gmail to email.  He has discovered Ebay (much to my mother's chagrin...) and watches the occasional YouTube video.  Truly, aHP Chromebook 14-c050 (Sparkling Black)would do the trick for him, but he likes a bigger screen.Regarding price please note that during Black Friday this PC was less than two hundred, so paying more than three now would be silly.The HP 2000 series laptops are good machines, but look for one with a AMD 'A' processor with at least 3MB of L2 cache for the best performance.  The 1MB of L2 cache and the 'E' processor really make this PC very slow compared to others at this same price point.Video and sound are both OK, but nothing special.  Adding a Bluetooth speaker (with adapter - purchased separately) or headphones will help the sound.  The video is fine for online streaming and DVD watching, but not fast enough for serious gaming.Battery life is about 3.5 hours on a full charge, depending upon your usage.  If you're watching a DVD, the battery will drain faster than if you're emailing.This PC runs Windows 8, 64-bit.  I recommend you upgrade (for FREE) on the Microsoft website 'dowloads' to Windows 8.1 when you unpackage it - before adding other programs.  It adds a Start button that was part of Windows 7, but was missing from Windows 8, as well as a few other little things.  NOTE:  You get 60-Days FREE Norton Internet Security with this PC.This PC is nothing special, but as stated before, if the price is low enough, it'll be OK for the basics.These are the specs on this laptop, per the HP website:Microprocessor 1.3GHz AMD E-300 Accelerated ProcessorMicroprocessor Cache 1MB L2 CacheMemory 4GB DDR3 SDRAM (1 DIMM)Memory Max Maximum supported = 8GBMemory Slots 2 user accessibleVideo Graphics AMD Radeon HD 6310 Discrete-Class graphicsDisplay 15.6-inch diagonal HD BrightView LED-backlit display (1366x768)Hard Drive 320GB 5400RPM hard driveMultimedia Drive SuperMulti DVD burnerNetwork Card 10/100BASE-T Ethernet LAN (RJ-45 connector)Wireless Connectivity 1x1 802.11b/g/n WLANSound Altec Lansing dual speakersKeyboard: Full-size keyboardPointing Device Touchpad supporting multi-touch gestures with on/off buttonExternal Ports:  Multi-format digital media card reader for Secure Digital cards3 Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.01 HDMI1 VGA (15-pin)1 Headphone-out1 Microphone-inDimensions 1.20 in (min H)/ 1.41 in (max H) x 14.80 in (W) x 9.72 in (D)Weight 5.39 lbPower 65W AC adapter6-cell 47WHr 2.2 Ah lithium-ion batteryFront facing HP TrueVision HD Webcam with integrated dual array digital microphone",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SMcAQN2tL._SY300_.jpg

Prior to this purchase I've been using aGriffin Navigate In-Line Controller and FM Radio for iPod & iPhone (Black)to listen to my iPhone or iPod through the car stereo. (Won't be missing that cassette player any time soon!)In my search for a replacement car stereo I was looking for some basic functions. I wanted Bluetooth for music streaming and hands-free calling. I also wanted HD radio and a CD if possible, but until I saw this unit which is now discontinued by Kenwood, I didn't think I could afford such perks at a low price point.Here's my take on this receiver. I love listening to music, and I make and receive approximately 5 calls a day. I'm a daily commuter who spends about 15 to 20 hours a week driving.The PROS:+ Excellent sound from stock speakers! Clarity & power boost I didn't expect.+ Bluetooth connectivity for music streaming & hands-free calling. NOTE: Bluetooth streaming set from factory to the front two speakers, but you can change it to 'all'.+ Clear calls via Bluetooth (Although calls sound quality will vary by phone and microphone placement - adjust mic echo if needed with head unit.)+ Voice dialing - if your phone will do it, you can do it over Bluetooth with this receiver.+ Phonebook in my iPhone 4S syncs with receiver to show me who is calling.+ Register (pair) up to 5 Bluetooth devices (phones, iPad, etc...) at the same time.+ Wireless remote is included+ Automatically mutes music when a call comes in.+ 22W RMS wattage; many at this price point have 14 to 18W.+ Front AUX port.+ Front USB port.+ CD text displays album, song and artist on some discs.+ Detachable faceplate for added security. (Although this isn't easy to get on and off in my opinion.)+ HD (digital) Radio, which if available in your area offers incredible clarity and richness over analog radio. *18 presets available.+ Very good AM radio reception in my area with my 2003 4Runner - easily picking up distant analog (AM) stations.+ RDS - Radio Data System compatible; showing info on your dash if available.+ Equalizer presets that correspond to different types of listening preferences.+ Expandable; (2) pairs preamp outputs (2.5V).+ Pandora, Aha, and iHeart control built-in (get the apps on your phone and make sure you're logged in to use them).+ Steering wheel compatible **with adapter that's not included.+ 13-digit display can change colors; 24 available.+ SirusXM radio ready; if you have a subscription.+ Will play MP3s via USB flash drive like this one:SanDisk Cruzer Fit 8GB USB 2.0 Low-Profile Flash Drive- SDCZ33-008G-B35or MP3s on CD.  TIP: If you use the flash drive method, you may want to stick with 4-8GB drives as finding songs on larger drives could take a lot of time. I like to use different colored nail polish on my low profile drives to indicate different genres of music on each drive.+ Firmware upgrade is available from Kenwood's site; came out in January 2014. Put it on a flash drive and use front USB port to upgrade your unit. This should take care of any intermittent shut off issues experienced by some users. Whole process for firmware updates (2) at present - took me 40 minutes to get the deck upgraded. You can also download the manual for this item on the same page: kenwood.com/cs/ce/index.php?model=KDC-BT755HD&lang;=index+ Works with iOS (Apple), Windows & Android smartphones!+ Internal memory saves favorite radio stations, even when battery is disconnected; no need to reset.The CONS:- Discontinued model; support or replacement if needed, may be an issue.- Wiring harness and associated installation costs. (I had mine installed by the local shop for less than one hundred dollars.)- Operation of the deck (switching through modes) could be easier. Using the included remote helps.- (1) button takes you through multiple modes (Radio-Bluetooth...) and it would have been nice to have a button dedicated to each source, but maybe if it had been a double-din?- Slow to pair with Bluetooth devices (10-30 seconds).- LCD screen is sometimes tough to see in bright sunlight.- Microphone placement can be tricky to get the best sound quality for Bluetooth calls. (Mine was installed on the steering column.)For me, this was a solid buy, where the Pros far outweigh the Cons. I debated about brands; looked at Pioneer, Alpine, JVC and Kenwood, and found them all to my liking. I looked at double-din models like the:JVC KW-R900BT In-Dash AM/FM/CD Car Stereo Receiver with Bluetooth, and other single-din models like the:Alpine CDE-135BT CD Receiver with Advanced Bluetooth Wireless Technology. They all offered similar specs, but none had the whole package offered by this model.I'm thrilled to have a quality Kenwood receiver that has such great features that has the ability to support even more upgrades if I choose. Having the CD player was not necessary, but a nice bonus, as so many head units are eliminating them. Bluetooth for hands-free calling and streaming of music works beautifully, which is why I bought the unit. Being able to put in a flash drive via USB and access custom playlists, stream Pandora, and listen to HD radio was just the icing on the cake!If you're looking for a solid performer with great specs, expand-ability and nice power for stock speakers, this is a great choice.SPECS:Warranty Terms - Parts 1 yearWarranty Terms - Labor 1 yearHeight 2-1/16\Width 7-3/16\""Depth 6-1/4\""Weight 2.7 poundsMaximum Watts per Channel: 50W x 4RMS Wattage: 22W x 4CD Signal to Noise Ratio dB: 105dB""",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LEtYWL1HL._SY300_.jpg

Believe it! This is a quality made ARCTIC product that does what it promises to do, and is backed by a solid 2 year warranty.Compatible with all smartphones including iPhone, Samsung, Blackberry, HTC, Motorola, Nokia, Sony and LG.  This battery is about the same size as an iPhone 4S with an Otterbox case (my point of reference is my own...), and it weighs only about a quarter of a pound and comes in 4 colors.The 4000 mAh capacity is excellent for tablets, which just can't get the juice they need to fully charge from anything smaller.  (At least not from a battery at 10% or so.)  While this power bank can take up to 6 hrs to fully charge, it can remain on standby for up to THREE YEARS!  That's a crazy-long time to be waiting for something to hook-up to it, but it's nice to know that if you travel with it, the back-up won't be discharging until you want it to do so.I also like that this battery has short-circuit and over-current/voltage protection.  Meaning, you can't over charge this one, potentially damaging it.  You can fully charge the internal Lithium Polymer battery up to 1000 times.Shipping with a carrying pouch and two cables whereby you can attach most music players, digital cameras, Bluetooth headsets and speakers, smartphones and tablets.  (NOTE:  30-pin and Lightening cables are not included, but you can use any cables to charge devices with a USB connection.Apple 30-pin to USB Cable andAmazonBasics USB A to Lightning Compatible Cable - Apple Certified - Black (3 Feet/0.9 Meter)will work and aren't too expensive.)The metal case doesn't really show fingerprints unless you've been eating greasy fries and haven't wiped your hands.  It stays cool to the touch while charging and discharging.I wish that the LED lights indicating battery levels were like some with a bank of four lights that diminish as the power is discharged.  As it is you need to consult the included documentation (or one of several Amazon reviews...) to know the code to read percentages of battery depletion for this product.I've been lucky enough to try several brands of power banks similar to this one (Duracell Portable Power Bank Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery (4000mAh) for iPhone, iPad, Samsung (Black)for example, and I find this product superior in construction, and competitive in price and performance.  Backed by a great warranty, there's truly no reason not to buy this product if you want a battery back-up that can easily be tucked into your bag or pocket for charges on the go.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-IC6N-TCL._SY300_.jpg

In the end, I chose a refurbished Roku 3 (90 day warranty and Prime shipping, 'like new' out of the box) to get the faster processor (5 times faster) and dual-band (2.5Ghz and 5Ghz) capabilities, with the perks of the newly acquired YouTube channel.I own several Roku boxes, and for the past 5 years have used them to stream Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon videos.  I find that the other channels (while nice to have) are not often used in my household, but since dropping cable and seeking streaming media to replace lost programming, I find I appreciate having so many viewing options.I also own an Apple TV, which I like primarily for mirroring from my iPad to my HDTV.  I also like that it has a YouTube channel, but both are infrequently used, albeit nice to have from time to time.  The ability to look at my iTunes library; listen to music, view videos and photos, make this a great choice too.  But if you find that most of your video rentals are through Amazon, you'd be disappointed in the Apple TV as Amazon isn't supported.The Roku 3's remote and its need to be paired (mine did out of the box...) is odd, but if you read through the directions, it's simple to do.  Just like the rest of the Roku set-up and use.  I like the headphone jack addition to the remote, which makes it great for late night viewing.WHY ROKU 3 WORKS FOR METhe speed with which this one moves through the User Interface (UI) is remarkably fast compared to previous versions, and it's made it easier and more enjoyable to find what you want to watch.  My other Roku's (LT, XS, HD, original), all lag way behind this one in terms of 'zippiness', but again, it's a processor thing.The dual-band feature is a big deal.  TIP: Leave one bandwidth free exclusively for streaming purposes in your home, and then put the Roku 3 on that band.  Your viewing experience will be stable and speedy!I have always loved Roku for its ability to stream content from Amazon, Netflix and Hulu Plus.  I love them even more for the improvements they've made in the speed and features of the Roku 3, and the channels that they keep adding to improve the experience.REGARDING GOING CABLE FREE WITH ROKUIf you have cut your ties with cable or satellite, or have a room that isn't wired for such, buy a Roku. We've done it along with the help ofMohu Leaf Ultimate Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna(check out my video review of it via the product link) andWinegard FL5500A FlatWave Amplified Razor Thin HDTV Indoor Antennaover-air antennas.Yes, there are some ongoing subscription costs for Netflix ($8 a mo), Hulu Plus ($8 a mo) and Amazon Prime ($79 a year).  You also have to register the device, and may end up purchasing the occasional movie from RedBox, Amazon or others, and/or subscribing to a sports channel.  Despite these costs, you'll still be saving hundreds per year, and regain your freedom from contracts.NOTE:  I have used my Blu-ray player to wirelessly access Netflix and Hulu Plus, but find that the Roku 3 is so much faster, it's well worth the money and lack of frustration. Apple TV is not as fast as the Roku 3 either, but it does have that 'mirroring' perk, and access to my iTunes library so it sits next to the Roku 3, but gets used much less often.NOTE: Go into SETTINGS on your Roku once you get things set up.  Change things related to sound (stereo sound by default, with surround as an option) and picture (720P by default, with an option for 1080P).  You can also change how the homepage appears (which channels pop up), screensavers, etc... via this menu.NOTE: Set-up will take about 30 minutes between entering in your password for your network, and having the Roku due an update and install channels.  If you have Hulu Plus, Netflix, and Amazon, you'll also want to have your usernames and passwords handy to get those channels online.  If you install a microSD card, the channel info will be stored on that card so that channels will load a smidge faster.UPDATE: 2/1/14I've enjoyed the 1st Season of Downton Abbey via Amazon Prime Instant Video on my refurbished Roku 3, and I have to say the speed of navigation is a noticable improvement over other models I've owned!  Fast forwarding, picking up after a pause, and the initial streaming of the programming is all quick and enjoyable to use. NO buffering issues!  Part of that is the ROKU and part of it is the channel that's streaming to it combined with your internet connection.One issue that occurs occasionally is upon initially going to the home screen I don't always see the app pictures.  I can navigate to hover over where I expect them to be and see text that says 'Netflix' or similar, and once I click I then see the app pictures.  It only happens at first when I've switched from TV to the HDMI input of the Roku via my AV receiver.  I don't know if it's the Roku, the HDMI cable or the AV receiver, but one day I'll troubleshoot it and perhaps figure it out.  For now, it's a quirk and I just roll with it.Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this ROKU version.  Even resuming from buffering errors due to streaming from Netflix have been quickly resolved.Be sure that during set-up you update your ROKU in Settings.  That will give you the latest firmware and channel updates.UPDATE: 4/23/14I use this Roku every day to supplement my free, over-the-air TV in HD. Check out my book:Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV, which I wrote in response to so many people asking me: \How do you do that?\"" when I told them I cut ties with my cable TV.""",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31eS%2BLUuDsL._SX300_.jpg

It also has more charging ports, which are always nice to have.The bottom line for me is that the WR-111B is great to have for an overnight trip, day hikes or in an emergency bag that I keep in the car.  It's not quite as durable as I'd like, which is the reason for the 4 out of 5 star review, but it functions well and as expected.  For extended power outages though, I prefer the other model.  It too is not as ruggedly built as expected, but the additional features make it more desirable for extended time without power.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P86iZ46YL._SX300_.jpg

But when I was going on a road trip and wanted to have my Hulu Plus, Netflix, and YouTube available to share with others on a bigger screen, the Chromecast seemed like the perfect solution.I managed to get it for under thirty bucks which made me happy, but was disappointed that Amazon Instant Video support is lacking with the device. Even so, the price and functionality on multiple TVs seemed worth it to me.Used with my Chromebook, these are the 10 Things I discovered, using the Google Chromecast:1. Installation is a breeze if the Wi-Fi network you are using is a good one.2. The Chrome browser extension is easier than the iPhone app to use. (I had issues with getting the app to connect with the Chromecast when using my iPhone, but not with the Chromebook and another Windows laptop.)3. Video streaming lags at times (not on the device you're streaming from, but on the larger screen connected to the Chromecast) producing choppy video quality on the HDTV.4. Downloaded videos stream better to the Chromecast than live streaming from the web.5. Having access to Hulu Plus, Netflix, and You Tube via the internet, and being able to mirror them on the big screen is pretty cool!  Especially since this will work with any HDTV with a HDMI port, versus with the much more expensive Apple TV casting only from iOS devices.6. I really miss having Amazon Instant Video!7. The Chromecast is easy to setup, use and is so highly portable, I can see where it would be a great gift for guys and gals who are 12 to 25. (And those of us who are gadget geeks and just need more of them.)8. Chromecast will not replace my Roku in my daily use, as the streaming quality isn't as good and it lacks Amazon's connection.9. Chromecast has a cheap price, but it's quality built!10. While Chromecast won't replace my other streaming devices in this cord cutter's home (I don't have cable TV), it's a great gadget to throw into my laptop bag to bring with me on the road or to use to share projects at work.After using the Chromecast device I wrote a book -Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV, which mentions Chromecast as one way to enhance over-the-air FREE TV programming options for folks who drop cable or satellite TV.Overall, this is a great gadget that I hope will just continue to improve. In the next version of the device, I hope they add Amazon functionality and improve the iOS app. Either way, I'd say 'buy it' if you simply want to mirror your laptop onto a larger screen and do it wirelessly. Sharing streaming content is just the icing on the cake.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31Hgfy4y9DL._SY300_.jpg

I use XBMC software to stream photos, music, video and live TV from around the world to my TV, and I picked up the Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard k400r to make that job a bit easier and more enjoyable.Placing the Logitech receiver in a USB 2.0 port on my laptop, and removing the tabs to the batteries that came pre-installed in the keyboard, I was up and running in seconds using a Windows 8.1 PC.

I thought it would be a cool learning tool disguised as a game.  I wanted to get the latest version in hopes of an increased number of supported video drivers for the PC version; an issue mentioned in other reviews.INSTALLATIONMuch to my delight, it Rocksmitth 2014 installed perfectly on a HP 2000 laptop with an Intel Core 3i processor, 8GB of ram with a proprietary HP integrated video card - not listed as supported by the Rocksmith folks.  (I purchased the game knowing this - checking the maker's website first.)  I knew that I had a desktop that does have the supported set-up, so I figured if it came down to it, it was still usable for us.Prior to installation I had her get a Steam account.  The software installs with a DVD (one is included for PC and another for Mac), but uses Steam so it uses less of your system resources.  Despite this, some systems may run into issues with installation.  **Read all the reviews and ask questions prior to your purchase.  I recommend checking out the manufacturer's support area too.PLAYS LIKE A GAMEProbably because it is!  But it's a game that I think would appeal to ages 12 and up who also want to learn to play.  Rocksmith is very similar to Guitar Hero, but you use your own guitar and you're actually learning while you play the game.  The game also grows with you, so you continue to build on your skills.  The software adjusts and shows you things like how to tune your instrument.My daughter loved this software immediately.  She'd been looking up YouTube videos and had a book, but this software immersed and engaged her.I'm not sure if you can buy more songs to add to it (I think you can for XBox...), but that was one of her first questions to me.  It comes with about 70 songs, but enough to get you started and challenging enough to keep you going for awhile.CONCLUSIONUBI Soft has a winner in Rocksmith 2014.  They've put a lot of thought and innovation into this package, and it's a stellar way for beginning electric guitar and bass players to have fun while they learn.I purchased this for fifty dollars, which considering the price of the game and the cable sold separately, made this quite a nice deal.I highly recommend this software, but warn potential buyers that for the PC/Mac version, you'll want to have a supported system or be prepared to say your prayers and roll the dice on compatibility.For me at least, this version does work for Windows 8.1, with video graphics not mentioned as supported by UBI Soft, so I'm thrilled and so is my daughter.

Not designed for use on textured walls, however the adhesive is very strong and will work on them if the texture is minimal and the product is not overly stuffed with cables.I purchased this item through the Amazon Warehouse at a significant discount.  The package arrived with Installation Instructions and all the pieces pictured, however the package had been opened before.I wanted to contain the cable from myMohu Leaf 50 Indoor HDTV Antenna (formerly Leaf Ultimate)to my HDTV.  I used two of the strips and one elbow joint for this project to contain and guide the one cable from the antenna over a doorway and down one side of it to the TV.  I made sure the wall was clean and dry prior to installation, as well as making sure the cable would easily fit inside and that the strip would snap (locking it).TIP: Place the cable or cords into the Cord Mate II strip you want to use, and snap it shut,  prior to placing it on the wall.  Then peel back small sections at a time, pressing down on the section with the exposed adhesive and holding it for a few seconds prior to moving on with the installation.  This makes for easy installation.I installed one length, then attached the elbow to the installed length, placing the next strip inside the elbow (with the cord already snapped inside it) prior to removing its adhesive and completing the installation.I like that you can cut and paint or stain this product, however I didn't have the need to do either.There is a (2) power cord maximum capacity for this item per the Installation Instructions, however I think if you were containing speaker wire, you could easily fit at least 4 cords inside this item.  There is a warning not to loop cords inside the strips.A product that lives up to its promise of 'easy to install', it's also very durable, attractive and useful. Easy to place horizontally or vertically, I highly recommend this product for hiding unsightly cables and cords in any room of your house.NOTE: If you have the need to tidy up more than 2 cords at a time, you may want to consider another solution per the warning that comes with this product.  However it will be tough to locate a 'flat' solution with a higher capacity.

You have to be within a 15 mile radius of TV towers broadcasting over-air television transmissions in order to receive the signals and have them processed by the tuner in your HDTV.This antenna will work best for those in urban areas with towers within a 12 mile range.  I say '12' miles because if that urban area has lots of tall buildings between your FlatWave and the towers, you may want to choose the FlatWave or FlatWave amped instead.  A greater range and/or amplification will help provide you with a reliable signal.I returned this product to a local store after test driving it.  I've reviewed most of the Mohu Leaf products and Winegard FlatWave ones, and found several things to be true about all of them.1. They are simple to install and use.2. They are all quality products, Made in the USA.3. They perform well out of the box.4. Successful use of these products depends upon the location of TV towers in relationship to your location, making sure the product you buy has adequate range to pick up the signals.5. Proper placement of the product, and monthly refreshing of the channel search on your HDTV are the keys to happiness when using these products.The FlatWave Mini would work well in an urban setting with lots of close towers.  Rural settings with widely spaced towers at distances over 15 miles, or in areas with lots of geographical issues (valleys, mountains), will want to choose something else.  Once you get an idea of where your local towers are, you'll have a good idea of which flat antenna will suit your needs.Personally, I like theWinegard FL5500A FlatWave Amplified Razor Thin HDTV Indoor AntennaandMohu Leaf Ultimate Amplified Indoor HDTV Antennabecause my local towers are all at distances between 25-50 miles from my location.

I use the Mohu Leaf Ultimate at present as it has a 50 mile range, but I needed another flat antenna for our home gym and decided that the one channel I can't pull in (tower is 45 miles away) I would be OK not having in the gym.Hook-up is very easy. Just connect it to the cable in port on your HDTV, hang it up (you can lie it flat too) and do a channel search on 'air'. I can get 14 channels in the rural area I live and this antenna picked up 13; one is just out of range.  As with all the flat antennas, placement is key to successful use.  I powered the amplifier by the included AC adapter (connect the USB to the AC adapter), but you can easily power it via a USB port on your HDTV too.  NOTE:  I find that by using the constant AC power I have to do channel scans and auto tuning less frequently than when I use the USB port.As expected this antenna picked up all but one channel that was simply out of range for this antenna to pick it up.  NOTE:  Be sure that when comparing antennas to take special note of their range, as I've found them to be quite accurate.I pick up all the HD over-air channels (digital) and standard definition over-air that are available in my area with this antenna.  I'm sold on the 'amped' versions versus the non-amplified ones, as I think they provide a more reliable signal.I've yet to discover a flat antenna that doesn't do the job better than the old rabbit ear-type antennas, but be aware that your success with these antennas (Mohu, AmazonBasics and Winegard brands) will depend upon the following factors.1. Your location in relationship to the TV towers in your area.  You have to be within range of the towers to receive the signals, and the antenna you choose must have the power to reach out and grab those signals to send to the digital tuner in your HDTV.2. Placement of your antenna is key to gaining consistent quality signals and all the channels that are available.  Take the time to figure out what works best in your location.  Tall buildings, trees, mountains, the building you are in and tower location will all factor in.  NOTE:  If you live in a city, you may be able to get lots more channels than in a rural area, but the quality of those channels may still be affected by the previously mentioned factors.You need to do a monthly channel auto-search and save to get the best reception. Weather can affect over-air channels, so be aware that the reception you get may be pixelated or unavailable at times when cable is not.You CAN cut out cable TV bills by using this antenna.  I cut the cable cord and now use flat antennas (both Winegard and Mohu products...) to save $80 a month.  I use flat antennas for network channels and supplement with Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu Plus and other channels off Roku and Apple TV devices.I'm impressed with this USA made FlatWave Amped.  It's not very big, can be hidden behind a curtain or wall hanging, and has a generous 18.5' cable length.  It works as expected, is well constructed and comes with clear directions.  If it's priced right, don't hesitate to snap one up for your home, office or travel trailer.TIP:  If you want to hide the cable that's attached to your antenna, consider getting a paintable cable management system that can be adhered to your drywall.  About twenty bucks for around 12' seems to be the going price.UPDATE: 4/23/14I received so many questions about how to use flat antennas and get free over-the-air TV that I wrote a book on it.Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TVshows you how to setup your flat antenna, what to expect from cord cutting, how to supplement with streaming media and more.

They also followed up the sale with an inquiry email, also offering assistance.  I like that kind of customer support!The product itself is as expected.  Thick, triple shielded coaxial digital audio/video cable that I promptly used to replace a cable that shipped with myMohu Leaf 50 Indoor HDTV Antenna (formerly Leaf Ultimate).Recent signal fluctuation and thus channel loss of over-air channels, prompted me to purchase this item. (*The cable that shipped with the Mohu Leaf Ultimate is very thin.)  As expected, this cable vastly improved the signal's strength and stability, allowing me to enjoy free HD over-air broadcasts without choppy transmissions or dropped channels.  I would not hesitate to buy more or recommend them to others.On a side note, I also like that Mediabridge has a EZ Grip end cover built into their cables, which is easily removed if desired.  This makes it easy to grasp and twist the end of the connector and seat it properly when connecting to the cable attachment.  It also neatens up the look by covering the connection.UPDATE: 4/23/14I use this coaxial cable with my over-the-air antenna and recommend it in my book:Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV. It really is the best cable I've used and works very well for eliminating signal loss.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416YJoHWIpL._SY300_.jpg

To know if that is where you live, go to AntennaWeb or AntennaPoint online to see what broadcast towers are in your area. If the TV signals are farther than 30 miles out (or right on the edge of that range...), don't get this Mohu Leaf - go for the amplifiedMohu Leaf 50 Indoor HDTV Antenna (formerly Leaf Ultimate) - Manufacturer RefurbishedorWinegard FL5500A FlatWave Amplified Razor Thin HDTV Indoor Antennainstead.Most over the air TV reception issues are tied to three things: antenna distance from available towers (range), weather, and placement of the antenna at your location. There are other factors, but these are the biggies, and getting an antenna that's suitable for your location is the first step to success. Mohu Leaf and the Mohu Sky antennas all work very well for capturing both analog and digital TV signals over air.NOTE: I totally believe in refurbs for their quality and performance. They come with a 90 day warranty and work as well as the new ones.I wroteSimple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TVbecause I love my flat antenna and free over the air TV so much! I've cut ties with cable TV and save $100 a month being a cord cutter.This antenna is ideal for city dwellers with over air broadcast towers in a 30 mile range, who don't live amidst a bunch of tall buildings. (The signals tend to bounce off tall buildings.) People who have this antenna and are in range of towers without buildings for interference, but still having issues, need to consider upgrading their coaxial cable. The coaxial cable that comes with the Mohu is very thin and I've experienced signal loss when using them .  Upgrade to a triple or quad shielded cable like this:Cable Matters 2-Pack, CL2 In-Wall Rated (CM) RG6 Quad Shielded Coaxial Patch Cable in Black 15 Feet. Signal loss is a big issue that can be easily fixed by this cheap upgrade.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21YBKew-5-L._SY300_.jpg

Tripp Lite is not a brand I have ever purchased before, but I must say that out of the box it seems more substantial than the Belkin branded surge protected power strip it replaced.I liked that three ports were dedicated to larger connectors, and that the cable (in/out), phone and ethernet ports were clearly labeled, especially since I didn't really find a clear 'how to' in the directions regarding hook-up on these.For example, when hooking up myMohu Leaf 50 Indoor HDTV Antenna, I did what made sense to me. I connected my over air antenna into the 'in' for cable, and then took a short bit of coaxial cable from the Tripp Lite and put it directly into the Ant-In port on my TV. Everything worked perfectly, so I guess I did it right and now have surge protection for that device and can enjoy FREE over-the-air TV. (I'm a cord cutter who wrote:Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TVto help non-techy types.)For internet (wanted a wired connection directly to my HDTV), I connected the Ethernet cable into 'in' on the Tripp Lite, and then took a short Ethernet cable  from the surge protector to my TV's Ethernet  port. Again, protecting the connection.I kind of wish the ports for the Ethernet and cable were on the side of the unit as there's not much room when this thing is fully loaded with connected devices, but on the other hand it's nice to have the cables running 'up' from the strip on the floor, versus an octopus-looking thing that takes up more room.Overall, I'm very pleased with this item. It has a super-long (10') heavy duty cable attached and would be perfect for a shop or home office. I am confident I made the right purchase at the right price and will recommend it to others.TIP: If you want to increase the usefulness of this product, consider using 'Y' cables to double some of your outlets.Tripp Lite P022-001-2 1ft 18AWG Power Y cord (NEMA 5-15P to 2xNEMA 5-15R)is what I purchased and they work great!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VSC4fUXVL._SY300_.jpg

The first, theMohu Leaf 50 Indoor HDTV Antenna (formerly Leaf Ultimate)- see my video review of that item to see how it works -  amplified with a 50 mile range, is what I use every day to pull in over-air HD channels in my area since cutting ties with Charter Cable. It works great for pulling in all the major networks, PBS and a few others.  About 14 total channels, which is what the antennaweb dot org folks say is available in my area.  The second, theWinegard FL5500A FlatWave Amplified Razor Thin HDTV Indoor Antennaamplified with a 35 mile range (purchased at Costco), gets all but two of the channels.  We use that one in our home gym on a TV that is seldom used and the two missing channels aren't a big loss.WHY I BOUGHT THE SKYRecently the Leaf Ultimate lost one of the major network channels.  I did a channel autoscan and it didn't find it.  This was curious to me as it was being broadcast the closest to my home.  I had been curious about the Sky for a long time, wondering if a 10 mile range increase would help my signal and pull in signals from even farther away - which some have reported.What I found out was whether the Mohu Sky was mounted in the same spot as the Leaf Ultimate or in the attic, I got the same number of channels.  I would expect that if we lived in a more signal-rich area, I might have gained some channels.  The signal strength from all the channels I do get increased, with nearly all at 100%.  That was great, but I was really struggling with the additional one hundred plus dollars for an antenna that didn't give me any more channels than the current one.As I looked at the Mohu Sky I noticed the included 30' cable was considerably thicker than the one that came with the Mohu Leaf Ultimate.  I decided to do an experiment.CABLE SWITCH-A-ROOI put both antennas in the same spot (previously found to be optimum) in my living room.  I did channel scans for each with the cables they shipped with and noted that the Sky nabbed all the available channels with excellent signal strength, and the Mohu Leaf Ultimate grabbed all but two channels (the reason I had gotten the Sky in the first place was to recover the two channels...) and had signals ranging from 75-100% signal strength.I then put the thicker cable; the one that shipped with the Mohu Sky, on the Mohu Leaf Ultimate antenna.  I did a channel scan and recovered the two lost channels with nearly every channel at 100%.  Changing the cable to the thicker indoor/outdoor one, made the difference.THE LESSONFor me, in my location, I don't need to spend the extra money on the Mohu Sky and mount it on the top of my house in order to gain all the over-air TV in my area.  The 50 mile range on the Ultimate with a new cable did the trick!  I have ordered a triple shielded cable to replace the thin one that came with the Ultimate, and fully expect it will solve my signal loss issues.Is the Sky worth the extra money?  Yes, if you live in an area where broadcast signals are just out of reach, it's definitely worth a try!  But if, like me, you are getting the available ones, but losing channels occasionally and thought it might be the antenna, try upgrading the cable first. Replacing it for about ten dollars may be a cheap solution to your problem.The Mohu Refurbished Sky HDTV Antenna came boxed 'as new', with all the parts (including mounting hardware) and documentation.  It has a 90-day warranty and tech support is free and available via email and phone.  I would not hesitate to recommend Mohu refurbished units.  While the antenna had a few faint scuffs, it was nothing like a 'used' one.Like the other Mohu products, it's well made in the USA.  It works as expected and promised, and I have no hesitation recommending it to others who want to cut the cord with cable, but for my area - I just didn't need it.  What I did need, was an upgraded cable.NOTE:  I returned the Sky and bought a Mediabridge Coaxial Digital Audio/Video Cable (25 Feet) - Triple Shielded F-Pin to F-Pin with Easy Grip Connector Caps - White to use with myMohu Leaf 50 Indoor HDTV Antenna (formerly Leaf Ultimate).UPDATE: 4/23/14In response to questions about my over-the-air TV and use of Mohu antennas, I wrote a Kindle book:Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV. Newbies to cord cutting will find it useful. I don't go into the setup of the Mohu Sky, but there is a step by step to setting up a flat antenna, and lots more info on OTA TV, supplemental programming and how to cut ties with cable.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31mUnAtWA1L._SY300_.jpg

You cannot expect to just throw it up in a window or on a wall and have it work perfectly out of the box.  The work to find proper placement is worth it though, I promise you!Please read on...FACTORS TO CONSIDER WITH OTA CHANNEL RECEPTIONSeveral factors will determine whether you can successfully use the Mohu Leaf and find happiness with OTA programming.1. Placement of the antenna is key and may take several tries.  Look up where your OTA transmissions are coming from by going to antennaweb dot org and entering your address.  This will help you place the Mohu.2. Weather - blustery, windy, rainy weather will affect the signal unlike with cable TV.  I have aRoku 3 Streaming Player with Motion Remote (2013 Model)and an Apple TV to stream content via Wifi, so if the TV signal is less than optimum, I watch something else.  Saving a hundred a month by not paying for cable TV is worth it to me!3. Reception and range variances are common. It's not unusual for a Mohu user to pull in all the major networks in HD (NBC, ABC, CBS, PBS, FOX) and a few others, but you can't get channels if they are not within range and you may get duplicate channels.  In major metro areas you may get over 50 free channels, and in rural areas you may only get one or two.  **You won't get more channels than are available OTA, nor will you get channels that are out past the range of your antenna.4. Sports enthusiasts may want to stay with cable or satellite.  I saw the Super Bowl on Fox in HD OTA, but I don't get ESPN or similar cable channels.  Losing access to many sports events may be an issue for some, and something to consider as then you're left with subscription services on products like the Roku, which are limited.5. Your location will affect performance of any OTA antenna.  I live at the end of a valley with lots of mountains and thick forests between me and the TV towers.  This 50 mile range Mohu grabs all the available signals, which pleases me.  The amplification of the signal is what does it.  Non-amplified flat antennas have not worked for me, but may work for those in signal-rich areas where geography or architecture (tall buildings) are not a factor.NOTE:  I began having signal loss and pixelation, so I purchased the Mohu Sky, thinking I needed a stronger antenna to pull in existing signals at the edge of the 50 mile range.  Instead I needed a new coaxial cable.  I purchased and installed this one:Mediabridge Coaxial Digital Audio/Video Cable (25 Feet) - Triple Shielded F-Pin to F-Pin with Easy Grip Connector Caps - Blackwhich is much thicker than the one that comes with the Mohu.  What a difference!  I've eliminated signal loss and returned the Sky as I just didn't need it.I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants to cut ties with their cable or satellite provider.  It works as promised and couldn't be simpler to use or set-up.  My Mom has one, I have two, my best friend has one, and we've all happily handed back our cable boxes thanks to Mohu!NOTE: This is the same antenna (...other than its refurbished with a 90 day warranty from Mohu...) as theMohu Leaf 50 Indoor HDTV Antenna (formerly Leaf Ultimate)of which I've done a video review. ** The refurbs are equally as good as the retail ones in my opinion.

The quality is very competitive for a small microphone that you can stick about anywhere to record audio. With that, it's not nearly as good as most microphones over $20, but it's $20! The long, 20 foot cord is great in some instances, but might be too much in others (putting it in your pocket, etc.).You'll obviously need something to capture the audio; I recommend getting a cheap adapter for mics that use their own power source from eBay for like $5. The adapter allows you to use your phone as an audio recorder and saves you a good $100+ for a dedicated audio recorder like a Zoom H1. Your phone app might not have as many settings as the H1, but it works great in combination with this lapel mic. Because the ATR-3350 has its own power supply, you'll need to turn it on and off before and after usage, which can be annoying, but the battery is supposed to last a long time (months of moderate usage, from what I hear). Unfortunately, there is no indication as to how long it will last, so if you're doing an important shoot, be sure to put new batteries (watch/laser battery type) in before the session starts, to ensure it won't shut off in the middle of recording.Overall, this cheap mic is perfect for recording mobile audio to a phone or other dedicated audio recorder and I would highly recommend it! Just put a few batteries in your bag for times when you have an important shoot!",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414RVtnYuuL._SY300_.jpg

It can run off of 6 AA batteries or 2 of the rechargeable LP-E8 batteries for the camera. So far, everything seems to be working just fine, but if something goes astray, according to the top review, you might have a bad interaction with their customer service.It helps for added support with all the things you'd need to control your camera (scroll wheel, shutter button - with the half press, etc.). The grip is great for the added battery life, especially for photography. I tried using it with a smaller lens (50mm) and it worked fine, but when I tried to shoot a short video, I found it awkward to focus past the grip. It might just take getting used to, but be aware that it adds extra bulk to your camera, which can be good or bad.

There are much cheaper alternatives that work great for a lot of people (and you might want to consider those options), but it's almost impossible to find a 3rd party battery that lasts as long as the OEM ones. Another thing 3rd party batteries sometimes fail to meet is the battery indicator on your LCD screen. Some 3rd party batteries will either be full or dead, not giving you much judgement in between. These OEM Canon batteries will give you a rough estimate of how much life is left in the battery. Is it worth the cost? I've used both the OEM and 3rd party batteries and I think if the OEM battery benefits are what you need, then yes. If you don't need the added life or indication, consider 3rd party batteries.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21IkJRqLvzL.jpg

You'll be amazed at what this $100 lens can create on your DSLR camera. Images are crisp and overall vibrant. If you shoot on a camera with a cropped frame, the field of view will be less than ideal for shooting things too close, but if you have a full frame sensor, this lens provides just the right amount of field of view.The build quality isn't going to match that of a $500 lens because it doesn't cost $500! The lens case is plastic and doesn't feel very professional, but the glass inside is all that matter - and it creates professional results. You aren't going to be afraid to use this puppy in any scenario, encouraging you to go out and get some great shots! While the 50mm prime lens is great on many occasions, I find it does very well in creating portraits. With the wide aperture, you can get some really nice depth of field (blurry background), which improves the quality of a portrait enormously, in my opinion. Another great thing about the aperture opening so wide is that it allows for faster shutter speeds or a higher ISO to improve the image. This was my first and probably my favorite lens.

Because this microphone is merely a stick, it's possible that it might break, like mine did.

It's a great mouse, sure - but $200 great? No. Keep in mind I only paid about $70 for mine (the price has since gone up). It comes with bells and whistles like different profiles (for mouse changing sensitivity), two different grips (for different types of gaming), weights, and smooth or click scrolling. I find the different profiles to be unnecessary, as most games let you change that in the setting of the game itself (which is remembered in the game, rather than you remembering which profile it was on your mouse - which is also limited). I also find the two grips unnecessary, unless you are a serious gamer. The weight thing might be appealing to some, but it just seems like another reason to charge more (I haven't ever used them and I don't plan to). Most of these features might seem appealing to you at first - they were for me at least - but, if you're like me, you probably won't use a majority of them.Having said that, I do find the smooth/click mouse wheel setting to be helpful. When I play a first-person shooter game, having a click on the wheel is helpful because it only takes one click to change weapons, versus the 5-10% spin of a wheel, which is awkward. When browsing almost any other program, I prefer the smooth scroll. Being able to scroll down a page with one flick of the finger is so much easier than scrolling 10 times with your finger. Scrolling with the smooth wheel is comparable to flicking a tablet/phone with your finger and having it slide down the page, which is much more intuitive.Overall, I think this is a fine mouse for gaming, but I wouldn't recommend buying it at anything over $80. I feel like there are better mice on the market if you're going to be spending as much as, or more than, $100.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vcP9sYhtL._SX300_.jpg

That's awesome! When I heard about this, I didn't hesitate to buy it and try it for myself. The practical use of this might be limiting, but it's definitely awesome to be able to produce these kinds of images! Two things to keep in mind is that you'll lose autofocus and, because your lens is literally disconnected from the camera body, you'll not be able to change the aperture (assuming your lens has an automatic aperture instead of a manual one), which will affect your light control and under what lighting settings you can shoot in. The images are much darker when the extension tube is used, so keep that in mind. The on camera flash will probably create a shadow from the lens because of how close you're getting to the subject, so you can't really use it.I've used a 50mm and a 10-20mm lens on this extension tube. My cheap $100 50mm lens on this makes a sharp image that is super close up. The 10-20mm is much wider, but it is still very much macro! If you can hold a steady hand, you can get some pretty amazing shots with such a cheap piece of equipment. I would definitely recommend this for anyone interested, at all, in macro photography!

Of course it's more expensive, but it is categorized as a dedicated zoom lens, rather than the kit's categorization as a general lens. Because it zooms in so much, the image stabilization (makes a slight noise) on the lens that mechanically realigns your image is very helpful. This, in combination with post production stabilization, might make handheld video work okay. I got the 55-250 based on the Amazon ratings for zoom lenses and I'm glad I went with this one.If you plan on doing and video or even some photography, you'll definitely want a tripod or monopod to help stabilize the camera and remove blur. Another thing to note is that many lenses that don't cost a fortune are slow, meaning that the aperture doesn't open as wide as some other (mostly prime) lenses and inadvertently must slow down the shutter speed to let in the same amount of light. This is true for this lens; don't expect to zoom in and have a properly exposed image at night or in dark areas.Overall, I'm very happy with the performance of this lens. The image stabilization helps when zoomed in, but makes a tiny bit of noise. The autofocus works okay, but I wouldn't rely on it. While it's a relatively cheap lens, it is capable of performing at a high level (not so much under low lighting conditions).

I'd recommend it to anyone who feels they need something flexible, spill-proof, easy to clean, mobile, and durable!",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Jff0TJtnL._SX300_.jpg

To fix it, he just bought a faster card that I got with mine. The GoPro has made a name for small, wide angle, durable cameras like none before it. I would like to see more competition, but I appreciate the innovation that GoPro continues to bring. The quality, size, and performance of such a small camera is astonishing. You can shoot SUPER slow motion with this and a HIGH resolution, though not at the same time (lower resolution = higher frame rate). There is a setting called pro tune that basically lowers the contrast so you can do some color grading in an editing program if You'd like. There is also a timelapse option that I love to use and many more options. It's a versatile little camera that you NEED if you do anything that might be at all entertaining. Edit it and post it to YouTube! I got this so I could put it on my radio controlled multirotor helicopter that I made with my dad and even fly it by looking through the camera (first person view) and it works great for this! I don't think the price difference for the Hero 3+ is worth it and maybe you can wait for Black Friday to get it cheaper (that's when I bought mine). I recommend getting the Hero 3 black edition instead of the 3+, considering the price difference and few benefits.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41p10yO7akL._SY300_.jpg

The S1s ($60) are a fantastic bargain considering the sound quality you get, and the R3s ($130) offer greater audio fidelity, but the M5s also have a place at the entry level part of the spectrum. Naturally, they are the weakest of the Brainwavz canalphones, which one would expect simply by virtue of their price; however, this doesn&#8217;t mean that they are weak performers in their class.Since value is the primary issue here, I&#8217;ll start out by saying that these are quite a bit better than, say, the Apple earbuds, which sell for a little over $30 (if you buy them separate from your iPhone or iPod). They offer superior sound quality and sonic isolation, and thanks to the design, they stay lodged in your ear canals, whereas the Apple earbuds tend to fall out. Simply put, the M5s are a step up at a reasonable price.The M5s offer a level of sonic precision and bass response that you don&#8217;t find in conventional earbuds. Brainwavz supplies a range of ear tips in various sizes and shapes so that you can find whatever will give you the most comfortable, most perfect seal. Once you&#8217;ve found the right size, you can enjoy the very neutral, relaxed sound of the M5s. So many cheap earbuds accentuate the bass and triple (like the Beats by Dr. Dre headphones), but the M5s don&#8217;t skimp on the all-important midrange that contains the bulk of the aural information in music. It&#8217;s a balanced sound, which is really what you want.Also, they do a fine job with a limited amount of voltage. I own a pair of very expensive Etymotic Research canalphones, and while the sound is outrageously good, they only sound good when powered by an external headphone amplifier. My iPhone simply doesn&#8217;t supply enough voltage to match their impedance. Any portable device should be able to power the M5 with ease, which means you&#8217;ll get a fuller, more satisfying sound, even if you&#8217;re just using your portable device.The downside here is that the cabling is fairly thin, which means it&#8217;s less durable. The Apple earbud cables are a bit thicker with a better rubber lining. The M5s feel fairly unprotected, and you&#8217;ll need to treat them more gently. The other downside isn&#8217;t specific to the M5s, but is, rather, an issue with all canalphones. The issue is microphonics, which include the sounds of the cable vibrating against clothing and stuff like that. These are greatly amplified because the canalphones form such a tight seal in your ear. There&#8217;s no way around it. It can be disconcerting to some people, so take this into account before ordering.As usual, Brainwavz gives you a very nice carrying case. It&#8217;s rigid enough to withstand being tossed into your backpack/briefcase/whatever without worrying about being crushed. That, along with the varieties of ear tips makes the M5s an even better value.Who should buy the M5s? If you&#8217;re looking for a simple upgrade for your earbuds, this is a great, inexpensive way to see if you like canalphones. They&#8217;re not for everyone, as some people don&#8217;t like sticking things all the way in their ears. If you&#8217;re fairly certain that these look cool, I would recommend buying the S1s instead. They&#8217;re still a great value, but the build quality is higher and the sound quality is a fairly big step up. I&#8217;d recommend the M5s mostly to people who are looking for the best possible value and don&#8217;t mind giving up some sound quality for the very low price. At any rate, these will drastically improve your listening experience if you&#8217;re still using your stock earbuds. Highly recommended.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41AzO5YYF2L._SX300_.jpg

I got these for my sister because she needed a pair of headphones for music production with a passable microphone built in. Since I&#8217;m not really the target consumer for this sort of thing, I just wanted to explain this before getting into the review. I do have a great deal of experience with a wide range of headphones from mid-grade options like the Corsair to very expensive Sennheisers and everything in between. Thus, this review will mostly pertain to sound quality.First, the design is nice. It&#8217;s a closed back design, which eliminates a lot of ambient sound. The ear pieces are huge and will fully enclose your ears, provided you&#8217;re not a giant. The microfiber memory foam ear pads are very, very comfortable. A lot of headphones sound great, but they&#8217;re uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time, but the Corsairs will not fatigue you. I have two pairs of AKG headphones and while they sound amazing, they are not at all comfortable for long listening sessions. Not so with the Corsairs.The sound is surprisingly good. I didn&#8217;t have high expectations for these, but I was very pleasantly surprised. With cheaper headphones that aren&#8217;t necessarily aimed at a discerning audiophile type listener, you tend to find artificially bright treble and overly heavy bass. The Corsairs were more neutral that I would have expected. They actually had a nice midrange and a good overall sound. Perhaps they are a bit heavier in the bass than something totally neutral, but I think some slight bass emphasis is what a lot of people want these days, so maybe it&#8217;s not a bad thing for everyone.The Corsairs are a 32 ohm design, which means that you can power them adequately with a low voltage device like an iPod or a iPhone or a laptop without needing an external headphone amp. These will play plenty loud off of most any portable device, and they&#8217;ll even give you good bass response to boot.Overall, I must say I&#8217;m impressed. You can find better headphones in this price range if all you&#8217;re looking for is music, but if you can use the builtin mic, these are a nice crossover pair that will work for gaming and for music.

The portable Bluetooth speaker market is being flooded with options, and since I&#8217;ve recently had a chance to review three similar models, I&#8217;ll provide some points of comparison.First off, I&#8217;ll say that the sound quality of tiny speakers like this is marginal at best, but sound quality isn&#8217;t exactly the point when you&#8217;re dealing with this sort of thing. If you&#8217;re expecting deep bass, detailed midrange, and crystalline highs from a tiny speaker in a plastic enclosure, then you need to revisit high school physics because it&#8217;s just not possible. When I compare sound quality between the following Bluetooth speakers, keep in mind that quality is relative. Even the best sounding portable Bluetooth speaker is going to sound shallow and anemic when compared with conventional speakers.Second, the Bluetooth functionality works reasonably well. Syncing is as straightforward as it can be. However, I&#8217;m not a big fan of the control interface. There is only one button and it&#8217;s used to control power and syncing. I wish there was a separate button for syncing, but it at least offers a better experience than the Antec SP Zero, which I mention below.Third, the Sabrent is very ruggedly built. It&#8217;s made for outdoor use, so it can be around some water without getting ruined. I&#8217;m not in love with the design because it seems like a lot of space is wasted on the carabineer snap hook, but whatever. It&#8217;s so inexpensive that it doesn&#8217;t matter.Now for the comparison.Antec SP Zero (approximately $50-70). The Antec sits right in the middle of the pack both in terms of price and in terms of sound quality. The bass gives the impression of being punchy, although on a smaller scale than you would find with larger speakers. The mids and highs are reasonable, but nothing too amazing. Anyone telling you differently either has very low standards for aural excellence or has not had a chance to audition the competition.Sabrent Mini Outdoor Portable Bluetooth Speaker (approximately $20). The Sabrent model is the cheapest by far and it actually plays louder than the Antec. It&#8217;s bass extends slightly deeper as well. The highs are duller than the Antec and the Edifier, but sometimes volume can make up for quality, especially if you&#8217;re using this outdoors.Edifier MP260 Extreme (approximately $80). The Edifier is the most expensive option, but at only $30 more than the Antec, it&#8217;s actually a huge step up in sound quality and volume level. Sure, it&#8217;s a bit bigger in size, but it&#8217;s still very portable and weighs about the same as all three models. It actually has some decent bass response, partially due to the larger enclosure. It uses two drivers where the Sabrent and the Antec use only one.Since each of the above speakers are similarly sized and share the exact same functionality as far as Bluetooth connectivity, the real question is: how much do you want to spend and what level of sound quality are you satisfied with? The Sabrent is a great value and plays louder than the Antec. The Edifier is more expensive, but the sound quality and volume are superior to the others. Unfortunately, this means the Antec is not remarkable in any capacity. Compared to the Sabrent, it&#8217;s too expensive and doesn&#8217;t do anything to justify its price.Overall, I can recommend the Sabrent to anyone who wants a very affordable, durable Bluetooth speaker. The sound isn&#8217;t amazing, but at this price, it sounds better than one would expect.Disclosure: I received this product from Sabrent to review. I did not allow this to influence my judgment and opinion.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51LpCmnTvML._SY300_.jpg

At this point, I own twelve pairs (I know - I have a problem) encompassing a wide range of styles from the inexpensive AKG 240s to the high end Beyerdynamic DT 880s. Impressively, the Brainwavz R3s compare quite favorably to some headphones that cost much more.Since these are canalphones, I&#8217;ll base my primary comparison on a similar pair that I own by Etymotic Research - the ER4Ss.The Etymotics are more than twice as expensive as the R3s and they do have an edge in terms of absolute sound quality. They have a higher impedance, which is a blessing and a curse. The ER4Ss have a greater dynamic range, but they also require more voltage to drive. This means that they sound flat and lifeless unless you&#8217;re using a headphone amplifier, which isn&#8217;t terribly convenient. In contradistinction, the R3s have a lower impedance, which makes them much more satisfying when using a low voltage device like a laptop, iPod, or smartphone. You&#8217;ll get an additional layer of sonic detail and dynamic shading with the more expensive ER4Ss, but the inconvenience is a significant factor.Beyond sound quality, there are a few things that the R3s do much better. The Etymotics use a tiny threaded cable that provides virtually no protection from vibration, which means that if you move the cables, you&#8217;ll hear a lot of microphonics. This is a problem inherent in all canalphones, but the R3s use a thicker, rubberized cable, which dampens some of the microphonic vibrations. This makes a big difference, especially if you&#8217;re not planning on sitting quietly every time you want to listen to music.The bottom line is that the R3s sound very good and they are much more practical than the ER4Ss. You can get a nice, full sound from a portable device, and you can wear them without noticing as many microphonic disturbances.The R3s have a few other nice features that make them worth checking out. They come with a huge variety of ear tips in all shapes and sizes. When using canalphones, it&#8217;s absolutely crucial that you get a good seal, otherwise you&#8217;ll lose any sort of bass presence. With all the varieties Brainwavz includes, you&#8217;re sure to find something that works for your ears.The R3s also come with a nice carrying case that is rigid enough to provide protection if you want to toss it into a backpack or something. The Etymotics also come with a little case, but it&#8217;s soft and doesn&#8217;t do much to protect what&#8217;s inside. As an added bonus, Brainwavz also throws in an airplane adaptor, which is not something I&#8217;ve seen from any other headphone company. All in all, they really give you a nice array of accessories.Now, a few words about the sound of the R3s. The sonic signature seems very well balanced. There is plenty of bass, but it&#8217;s not overpowering. The highs are smooth, and the always important midrange feels relaxed and natural. Where the Etymotics sound more precise and analytical, the R3s sound punchy and forward. Because they have more bass presence than the Etymotics, the R3s are better suited for certain musical styles like rock, electronic, and the like. They do a good job with more acoustic styles like jazz, classical, and mellow singer-songwriter stuff, but they&#8217;re best at louder, more electronically grounded styles. That said, I was pleased with the performance of the R3s with virtually every recording I tested them with.Since most people will be using the R3s with some sort of low voltage, portable device, that&#8217;s primarily how I tested these; however, I also listened through my high-end headphone amplifier just to see how they performed under the best possible conditions. I didn&#8217;t actually notice a huge difference in sound quality. There was a bit more detail and the dynamic range improved somewhat, but really, these sound just about as good coming straight out of an iPhone.Overall, the R3s are a great value. The sound is very good, the accessories are useful, and the price is great. I highly recommend them!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uFJfO0lkL._SY300_.jpg

It&#8217;s an adequate stereo receiver. It&#8217;s not great and it&#8217;s barely good. The price is low, but (unfortunately) the performance really matches the price. The total harmonic distortion alone is unacceptably high - ridiculously high for a receiver by an ostensibly reliable brand like Yamaha. It plays loud, but it doesn&#8217;t play clean at high volume levels. There is a lack of unnecessary features, but this doesn&#8217;t mean the features that remain are better. Sometimes you get a really basic stereo receiver with no bells and whistles and the manufacturer has decided instead to concentrate on really good, pure sound. No such luck here. It&#8217;s just a basic receiver that performs adequately with a low price that is *almost* too high for what you get.This is usually the point when I would talk about cool features, but seriously, the R-S201 doesn&#8217;t have any! It has a headphone jack, it allows you to connect two pairs of speakers, it has a power saving feature, it has a remote control. This is like shopping for cars and having the deal brag about how the car has a steering wheel and doors.You might think I&#8217;m being unreasonable and writing from an unrealistic audiophile perspective. Perhaps this is partly true because, yes, this might actually be a serious upgrade for some buyers, but it&#8217;s also just me interpreting the specs and seeing their inferiority manifest in the sonic experience. The only way I could recommend this receiver is if you fall into one of two camps: 1) Maybe you&#8217;ve got one of those all-in-one systems from your dorm room, you&#8217;re now ready to put together a proper system, but you can&#8217;t afford to spend proper money on every element. In that case, the R-S201 will be a notable sonic improvement (although not more notable than other similarly priced models from other manufacturers). I&#8217;m practical. I realize that it&#8217;s tough to move beyond the all-in-one system since you basically have to buy all the parts at once (or at least speakers, a receiver, and a CD player or turntable).Or 2), Maybe you&#8217;re setting up a secondary system in some sort of less-than-ideal environment and you just need something cheap to drive some similarly crappy speakers. Maybe you&#8217;ve got a man cave setup in the garage, or maybe you need something to power outdoor speakers. In both cases, you&#8217;re already making such big sonic concessions that you won&#8217;t necessarily notice the shortcomings of the Yamaha. In that case, by all means, don&#8217;t waste your money on quality that you wouldn&#8217;t even be in a position to appreciate.But, if you can spend even a little bit more money and you&#8217;re wanting to do some real listening in an indoor setting, I&#8217;d highly recommend looking for something else. The Onkyo TX-SR313 sells for around $200, has a much better (and lower distortion) amplifier, plus an array of features that are actually pretty handy, like built-in USB connectivity. Or, if you really want to save money, then buy something even cheaper that is equally good, like the Sony STRDH130. It sells for around $115, has lower total harmonic distortion, and handles the same amount of power (ca. 100 watts per channel).Also, if you&#8217;re in the stages of building your first setup and the price appeals to you, I would caution you if you&#8217;re at all swayed by the power handling. Your receiver doesn&#8217;t need to handle a lot of power. 40-60 watts per channel is more than enough to make most speakers play very, very loud. Yes, the R-S201 can play louder than the R-S300, but the difference in the quality of amplification is remarkable. Once you turn the R-S201 up past its halfway point, the sound quality drops off considerably. If you&#8217;re looking for a first receiver, go for something with a lower power rating, but also lower distortion.As you can undoubtedly tell, I&#8217;m kind of offended that Yamaha would put its name on such a mediocre receiver. It&#8217;s too expensive to perform this poorly. However, beyond my disappointment in Yamaha, there is also the legitimate complaint that is evident from looking at the specifications. For virtually everyone, I&#8217;d recommend avoiding this.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/316oBsD7UVL._SX300_.jpg

In each case, I am impressed with the level of audio performance, especially when you take the price into account.Focusing on the R1s specifically, they have a fairly bass-heavy sound. This is awesome if you like a lot of bass, or if you like certain musical styles like electronic music and rap. However, I don&#8217;t think the bass is excessively heavy. The Beats headphones are legendary amongst audiophiles for having way, way too much bass, and I have to agree. They sound horrible to anyone who has any concept of what a nice, neutral sound is like. The R1s are not that bad. The bass response basically translates into a very punchy sound.This punchiness comes at a cost, however. The midrange and treble sound subdued in comparison, and the treble in particular sounds a bit dull and lifeless when listening to certain other styles that involve acoustic instruments (e.g., jazz, classical, folk, rock albums mastered before the 2000s). Increasing the volume does seem to counteract some of the bass imbalance issues, but this is not something you want to do all the time. Since canalphones like this sit deep in your ear, it&#8217;s really easy to play them too loud and develop serious hearing loss. This is true of all headphones, but canalphones are particularly dangerous if you&#8217;re not careful. So, you can increase the volume to get more high-end presence, but you don&#8217;t want to increase it more than necessary. But, if you&#8217;re listening to any sort of electronic music or rap, you probably won&#8217;t mind these being bassier than other models.As usual, Brainwavz gives you a nice carrying case, a couple adaptors, and a large selection of different ear tips. As I&#8217;ve said elsewhere, my Etymotics came in a soft case that doesn&#8217;t offer much protection from being crushed. The Brainwavz case is rigid enough that you can toss it into your backpack/briefcase/purse and not worry about it being crushed by the other stuff in your bag.Despite me being somewhat picky about the frequency response curve of the R1s, they are very good earphones, and they will be a huge improvement to most anyone, especially if you&#8217;re using Apple earbuds (or the like). They are well worth their price.Overall, I believe the R3s sound the best, but I think the S1s are the best value. To my ears, they&#8217;re only slightly less detailed than the R3s, and they cost much less. Both the S1 and the R3 rival my expensive Etymotics canalphones, and I can easily recommend them to anyone wanting to try a pair of in-ear earphones. The R1s are quite good, but I would recommend spending 20 extra dollars to get the S1s.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BBMOPla6L._SX300_.jpg

It seems that every electronics manufacturer wants in on this new trend. Some of these speakers require AC power (like certain models by Panasonic and Hercules) and many are battery powered (like those by Jawbone, Bose, Klipsch, and Edifier). Now I&#8217;ve received the TDK TREK Max for review, so &#8230; let the comparisons begin!First of all, this is the only speaker of the (now seven) models I&#8217;ve tested that is &#8220;weatherproof.&#8221; It&#8217;s unclear what weatherproof means, since it changes depending upon what part of the literature you read.

At any rate, you can take this outside without worrying if it gets a little banged up, apparently.In terms of size, weight, and loudness potential, this sits somewhere between the Jawbone Jambox (smaller, ca. $150), the Klipsch Gig (same size, $200), the Bose Soundlink (same size, $300), and the Edifier MP260 (smaller, $100). Each of these are functionally similar, and most allow you to receive calls, thereby acting as a fancy speakerphone. Each claim to offer around 8 hours of battery life on a single charge.Within these similar products, there is a surprisingly large range in terms of sound quality. The Jambox sounds good, but it&#8217;s smaller and not as loud. The Bose has a characteristically bright sound that appeals mostly to older listeners who have some naturally-occuring hearing loss in the upper frequencies. The Edifier is the smallest and quietest with the weakest bass response. The Klipsch, to my ears, offers the most neutral sound with a wonderful, well-balanced midrange and a full sounding low end.Where then does the TDK TREK Max fit in this spectrum? In terms of sound quality, it&#8217;s not stellar. The highs sound muffled, as if someone had placed a heavy blanket over the tweeters. (To be clear, this system uses full range drivers, so there aren&#8217;t actually tweeters. This is just to illustrate how the highs sound muffled). The midrange is a little better, and the lower you get in the frequency spectrum, the more clear the speakers sound. The bass is surprisingly present. It&#8217;s not a huge system, but the amount of bass it produces belies is actual size.The real place where the TDK excels is in volume level. This plays a lot louder than you would expect. It&#8217;s certainly enough to fill a regular-sized room. You lose some of the impact when you take this outdoors, but this is natural. Without reflective surfaces, the sound just radiates into the atmosphere. However, since it produces a fairly powerful sound in and of itself, it should play satisfactorily loud (for most people) outside. I didn&#8217;t have any complaints.Not much is provided in the way of accessories. Many of the speakers I&#8217;ve mentioned come with bags for carrying, but not the TDK. It&#8217;s not a huge deal, but it&#8217;s a point of comparison. The supplied documentation is fine. Nothing too verbose, but it tells you what you need to know.One thing that I like are the controls. Too many of these speakers rely on only a few buttons that have numerous functions. The Klipsch is particularly annoying in this regard because it has, essentially, one button that does everything. Thus, you end up having to hold it in different places for varying amounts of time. I hate that. Give me different buttons for different functions! The TDK has all the buttons that I want to see on a bluetooth speaker: power, volume, pairing, and a few others. You turn the unit on, press the pairing button, and it connects quickly and easily.In terms of sound quality, I would highly recommend the Klipsch because even though its controls annoy me, it produces a beautiful, well-balanced sound with plenty of volume. However, if you want to use your bluetooth speaker outside and don&#8217;t want to worry about shielding it from the elements, this is a reasonable compromise. In this case, it&#8217;s not so much about the sound quality as it is about the convenience of having a weatherproof/resistant speaker. Since I see no reason to spend more on a Jawbone or a Bose, I can recommend this pretty easily.Basically, you need to figure out what you want from your bluetooth speaker. If you want something that sounds good, get the Klipsch Gig. If you&#8217;re elderly, get the Bose. If you want something stylish, get the Jawbone. If you want something for outdoors, get the TDK.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NW2u5OUmL._SY300_.jpg

For clarity&#8217;s sake, this review is of the Casem Skull and Crossbones Galaxy Cellphone Case.The case is made of rigid plastic and feels reasonably well constructed. The design is cool, if a bit feminine (probably due to the color). I got this for a friend who needed a case, and it fits his phone perfectly. It snapped on easily and didn&#8217;t add a lot of extra weight or bulk to his phone. Where some cases make the phone too big to fit easily in one&#8217;s pocket, this one doesn&#8217;t.In terms of protection, I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily chose this case. It&#8217;s more like a decorative accessory. The plastic is thin and doesn&#8217;t seem to offer any sort of substantial protection from, say, dropping. It will keep the back of your phone from getting scratched, but if I were to drop it with my phone inside, it feels like it might crack. If you want a cool looking shell for your phone, this fits the bill. If you&#8217;re clumsy or careless and you want protection, try a different model.The best feature of the Casem case is the price. There are plenty of cellphone cases out there, but often times they are significantly more expensive than the current listing price of around $9. If you like the design, this is a great and economical way to protect your phone.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41V4wGiR7kL._SY300_.jpg

Until now, I had been taking snapshots with one hand while trying to hold the book open with the other. It was annoying and led to readable, but mediocre results. The Ipevo stand is exactly what I always needed. It&#8217;s perfect for digitizing print media. I have no complaints. None at all.There are tons of other uses for this thing as well, although they&#8217;re not tasks I routinely perform. This is great for creating instructional videos, regular videos (using this as a sort of tripod), framing regular photographs at any angle, and probably other stuff too.One of the coolest features is the ability to stream video from this to a laptop from a top-down perspective. I teach a large music lecture course and it&#8217;s sometimes useful to show parts of a music score through the projection system. Until now, if I wanted to do this, I had to wheel in a large video contraption to do this, but the Ipevo does this perfectly.The stand is very well constructed and the base is heavy enough to resist toppling over, even when using extreme angles. The clasp grips your phone very tightly, and so you never have to worry about your phone falling out. Some people might be annoyed that you probably need to remove your phone from its case (if you have a large one) before inserting it into the stand, but I don&#8217;t keep my phone in a case, so this is no problem for me. Plus, it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re using this all the time anyway. Removing your phone from its case periodically to make a video or take some carefully framed pictures doesn&#8217;t seem like a huge deal to me.Overall, I love this stand. I hadn&#8217;t really thought about this sort of thing before, but now I find it incredibly useful and I wouldn&#8217;t want to be without it. If any of its uses sound intriguing to you, then check it out. It&#8217;s worth the money.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wLClfAWjL._SY300_.jpg

The portable Bluetooth speaker market is being flooded with options, and since I&#8217;ve recently had a chance to review three similar models, I&#8217;ll provide some points of comparison.First off, I&#8217;ll say that the sound quality of tiny speakers like this is marginal at best, but sound quality isn&#8217;t exactly the point when you&#8217;re dealing with this sort of thing. If you&#8217;re expecting deep bass, detailed midrange, and crystalline highs from a tiny speaker in a plastic enclosure, then you need to revisit high school physics because it&#8217;s just not possible. When I compare sound quality between the following Bluetooth speakers, keep in mind that quality is relative. Even the best sounding portable Bluetooth speaker is going to sound shallow and anemic when compared with conventional speakers.Second, the Bluetooth functionality works reasonably well. Syncing is as straightforward as it can be. However, I&#8217;m not a big fan of the control interface. There are two buttons for volume and a single button that controls both power and Bluetooth syncing. This is annoying because you have to hold the power/sync button for a long time to do anything other than turn the unit off. You hold the power button for about six seconds to turn the unit on, and continue holding it for another six seconds to put it in sync mode. This means you&#8217;re holding a button down for more than ten seconds to do something incredibly basic. It&#8217;s way too long and is frustrating. There is a voice that lets you know when certain functions are taking effect, but still, you&#8217;re stuck holding this button down for a long time.Now for the comparison.Antec SP Zero (approximately $50-70). The Antec sits right in the middle of the pack both in terms of price and in terms of sound quality. The bass gives the impression of being punchy, although on a smaller scale than you would find with larger speakers. The mids and highs are reasonable, but nothing too amazing. Anyone telling you differently either has very low standards for aural excellence or has not had a chance to audition the competition.Sabrent Mini Outdoor Portable Bluetooth Speaker (approximately $20). The Sabrent model is the cheapest by far and it actually plays louder than the Antec. It&#8217;s bass extends slightly deeper as well. The highs are duller than the Antec and the Edifier, but sometimes volume can make up for quality, especially if you&#8217;re using this outdoors.Edifier MP260 Extreme (approximately $80). The Edifier is the most expensive option, but at only $30 more than the Antec, it&#8217;s actually a huge step up in sound quality and volume level. Sure, it&#8217;s a bit bigger in size, but it&#8217;s still very portable and weighs about the same as all three models. It actually has some decent bass response, partially due to the larger enclosure. It uses two drivers where the Sabrent and the Antec use only one.Since each of the above speakers are similarly sized and share the exact same functionality as far as Bluetooth connectivity, the real question is: how much do you want to spend and what level of sound quality are you satisfied with? The Sabrent is a great value and plays louder than the Antec. The Edifier is more expensive, but the sound quality and volume are superior to the others. Unfortunately, this means the Antec is not remarkable in any capacity. Compared to the Sabrent, it&#8217;s too expensive and doesn&#8217;t do anything to justify its price.Not recommended.",2.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41794BqWkXL._SX300_.jpg

Upon receiving it, I tested it by simultaneously charger my iPad and my iPhone. The charger supplies a higher amperage than a normal charger, so it charges more quickly, at least in theory.

I can certainly say that, if nothing else, it didn&#8217;t charge *slower* than other chargers.Irrespective of the charging speed, it&#8217;s very convenient for someone with multiple devices, especially when traveling. My iPad comes with a hefty charging unit, and if I try to use the standard iPod/iPhone charger, it takes forever. The Inateck allows me to bring only one charger with me.The build quality is good, and after using the charger for a couple weeks, it&#8217;s still going strong.

It&#8217;s basically a regular pen with an 8GB hard drive. It has a tiny microphone to use as a voice recorder, which is cool. It also has an MP3 player, which blows my mind. Who in the world thinks, &#8220;man, life would be so amazing if only my writing utensil could play some Peter Frampton &#8230;&#8221; But hey - we live in the twenty-first century, and OXA has provided for us. I don&#8217;t mean to sound like I&#8217;m critical of the device. I just find it highly amusing that some engineers thought to make this an MP3 player on top of everything else. I have absolutely no idea who the target market is here. Maybe *I* am, insofar as I actually own one of these!The pen is pretty top-heavy, but it&#8217;s still fairly light. It unscrews in the middle which allows you to stick the top part into a regular USB slot. I&#8217;ve had mixed results getting various computers to recognize the device and mount the hard drive. I spoke with an OXA rep who was as helpful as he could be. This is Mac compatible, so the problem may have been on my end (I only own Macs right now).The pen comes with a nice metal case and OXA even throws in a tiny pair of earbuds. Writing with something that is attached to a cord leading to your ears is a weird experience, but maybe you&#8217;re supposed to set the pen down when you listen to music. Again, I&#8217;m not trying to bash the electronic pen. It&#8217;s a delightfully bizarre object.Finally, the box itself is highly amusing. A few highlights from the back of the box (sic to all): &#8220;Pen-shape design sophisticated appearance,&#8221; &#8220;Smooth writing pen, the cartridge run out can be replaced,&#8221; and &#8220;7  kinds of machine with balance tone color.&#8221; This is some amazing translator English. And again, this isn&#8217;t a problem for me. I think it&#8217;s endearing. Really, it&#8217;s entirely fitting that such a strange little device would have such a hilarious box.In conclusion, this is not, strictly speaking, a &#8220;smart pen.&#8221; It doesn&#8217;t record your motions.

With it&#8217;s huge database of remote codes, the possibilities are almost limitless. Unfortunately for me, I ran into one of these rare exceptions when I upgraded to a state-of-the-art LG TV with a crazy, voice-activated remote. I guess this means I&#8217;m stuck using two remotes for the foreseeable future, if I want to take full advantage of my new TV&#8217;s remote. Talk about your first world problems! Seriously though, until I got this weird new remote, the Harmony Ultimate One was perfect, and seeing as most people aren&#8217;t going to run into this issue, the LHUO (Logitech Harmony Ultimate One) is everything you will ever need.One initial point of clarification, since it has seemed to provoke confusion amongst inattentive shoppers: This is an IR remote, not an RF remote. That means that you need a clear line of sight between the LHUO and the component it is controlling. It won&#8217;t shoot through an opaque cabinet door. If you want that functionality, Logitech makes an RF version of the LHUO, although it sells for almost $100 more. There are a handful of electronics that use RF instead of IR. The Dish Network remote is an RF remote, so that&#8217;s an important exception to be aware of. Otherwise, IR works just fine for most people. Seriously, if you can&#8217;t be bothered to keep your cabinet doors open, then you probably won&#8217;t mind spending extra for the convenience of RF.Every setup is different, but I&#8217;ll describe mine here as briefly as possible. The specifics of what I&#8217;m doing with the remote are, obviously, less important than the overall idea of how much it can do. I have a TV, a Blu-ray player, a DVD player (it&#8217;s a long story why this is still part of my setup), an A/V receiver, and an Apple TV. It&#8217;s a pretty standard setup, but it involved me using five different remotes, which is a drag. The LHUO took care of all of them with ease. Programming the remote on my Mac was incredibly easy. Everything just worked. It was such a non-issue, that I don&#8217;t feel compelled to write much more about it!As for the physical aspects of the remote, I must say that it&#8217;s fantastic. It&#8217;s weighted nicely for perfect balance and feels substantial without being heavy. Basically, it feels like a well-made product. You might think this is totally secondary to its functionality, but since we spend so much time holding remotes, having something this well designed does make a difference.The buttons are clear, the layout makes sense, and it&#8217;s not packed full of obscure, unlabeled buttons. I&#8217;ve seen a lot of universal remotes that give you tons of assignable buttons, but realistically, there are only so many functions you can remember when something isn&#8217;t labeled. Picture yourself as a technophobic spouse, and that number drops even more. Every button needs to have a function that is intuitively expressed through its labeling if anyone other than you will use it.If you&#8217;re a guy (yes, it&#8217;s a cultural stereotype, but chances are, if you&#8217;re reading this, you are in fact a guy), you probably have a wife or girlfriend who wants to watch TV occasionally in your absence. Whether she embraces technology or not, if she didn&#8217;t program it, she&#8217;s going approach this with skepticism. I&#8217;ve seen my parents go through this song and dance many times. My dad thinks his new universal remote is the most intuitive thing in the world and my mom is so turned off by it that she uses all the old remotes both out of stubbornness and out of necessity. The beauty here is that there are actually very few buttons on the remote. Everything makes sense, just by looking at it. If you hand this to someone who didn&#8217;t program it, they&#8217;re probably going to be able to figure it out. That&#8217;s a design element that is almost invaluable.The touch screen works well, and this is probably why the remote can afford to be so simple. If there are weird features that you don&#8217;t need to access regularly, you can tuck them away in the touch screen menus - a place most other users (other than yourself) will ever need to venture. The only downside here is that the remote needs a lot of power to function. I prefer the simplicity of a basic, battery powered remote. The LHUO needs a docking station to function because it&#8217;s rechargeable batter needs to stay juiced. You don&#8217;t need to keep it in the dock all the time, and the charge actually lasts quite a while. But, you do need to have the dock accessible periodically and that means an extra power supply and an extra cable. It could be worse; the dock is minimal and looks decent. I just wish I didn&#8217;t need yet another piece of gear to tuck away somewhere.Overall, the LHUO is an incredibly well designed piece of gear. It&#8217;s well built, it&#8217;s easy to program, and most importantly, it&#8217;s intuitive enough for other users to grasp. I cannot over emphasize enough how important usability is for people who are not yourself. You&#8217;re awesome; you&#8217;re buying a universal remote. You&#8217;re excited about programming it, and you&#8217;re dedicated to learning how to use it most effectively. Everyone else just wants to watch TV in the simplest way possible. This actually IS simple enough that they won&#8217;t protest. Buy it for the functionality, but also buy it for the clean, logical layout.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EVxhoieBL._SY300_.jpg

This tells me one of two things: either the speakers are so terrible that the specs would just look embarrassing, or the companies know that the target consumers for this sort of thing is so aurally undiscerning that they won&#8217;t care about this omission. Both of these are probably true to an extent.In this review, I will compare the Klipsch Gig to three other self-powered bluetooth speakers that I either own or have spent considerable time with: The Edifier MP260, the Bose SoundLink Mini, and the Jawbone Jambox. But first, some detail on the Klipsch Gig itself.SoundKlipsch is a venerable speaker designer and manufacturer, although in the last 10-15 years, they have begun offering cheaper gear aimed at consumers who are audiophilic than their previous target consumer. Does their tradition of quality trickle down into inexpensive products like the Gig, or are they simply debasing their own brand with mass market junk? Again, in some ways, they&#8217;re doing both. The Gig is not going to give you the famous Klipsch sound that made them famous, but when compared to other speakers in its class (designated mostly by its size and the fact that it&#8217;s self-powered), it&#8217;s one of the best sounding bluetooth speakers I&#8217;ve ever heard.As expected, the bass is the weak part. This isn&#8217;t Klipsch&#8217;s fault; it&#8217;s just physics. For fuller bass frequency response, you need a bigger driver, more power, and a larger enclosure. That said, the bass response is much better than you might think when you see how small the Gig actually is. A few speakers, like the Edifier MP260, sound best when placed in a corner to naturally amplify the bass resonance, but the Klipsch does surprisingly well in open space. It&#8217;s pretty remarkable in that respect.The midrange is nice and full, and the highs offer a satisfactory amount of detail. Granted, this is the sound of dual 1&#8221; full-range drivers, so there is only so much one can do with these sorts of physical limitations. As far as listening experiences go with small bluetooth speakers, Klipsch has created something very respectable.Ease of UseThe controls are logical and intuitive. Most of the functionality is controlled by a large, multifunctional button/knob thing. The combo power and bluetooth pairing switch is located in a different place that is only accessible when you unfold the speaker from its builtin stand. This is a nice feature because it means you won&#8217;t accidentally turn it on or put it in pairing mode. Instead of the usual beeps when the speaker powers up or successfully pairs, the Gig plays a little sample of a guitar. One complaint is that the beginning of the sample always sounds like it&#8217;s arriving mid sound. Like the first fraction of a second is missing. It&#8217;s not really important, but considering how nice the design of the Gig is, this is not up to the standard set by the other features.BatteryThe Klipsch has the longest battery life of any of the speakers mentioned above at 12 hours. It&#8217;s hard for me to gauge how accurate the stated specs are since I never sit down and listen to it for 12 straight hours. I can tell you that the battery appears to last forever. Also, the Gig comes with a sticker that says that it has been fully charged and is ready to use. Maybe this is true, but I don&#8217;t trust it, and you shouldn&#8217;t either. It&#8217;s always a good idea to charge batteries like this for eight or so hours before using them the first time. It&#8217;s nice that Klipsch tries to give you a freshly charged battery in every box, but it&#8217;s just not a chance that I recommend taking.ConnectivityConnecting via bluetooth is very easy, and you can also hook in via an 8th inch stereo mini plug. The bluetooth range is as decent as any speakers I&#8217;ve found, although, as always, the further away you get, the worse it works. You start to get dropouts and other signal degradations at the edge of its range. Personally, I think bluetooth is a stupid way to transmit something that depends on a constant signal, like music, but people seem to love the convenience, so I guess I&#8217;m in the minority.OtherAs I stated above, the design is very nice. The speaker looks elegant, as does the large knob with its green LED indicators. The speaker also comes with two separate carrying cases: one for the speaker and one for all the accessory cables. There is a USB cable used for charging, a male-to-male stereo mini plug, and an AC adaptor with various outlet adaptors in case you travel abroad. Finally, the speaker is just incredibly light and small. It's tough to get a sense of the size and weight from the pictures, but it will impress you with its dimensions.ComparisonHow then does the Gig compare to other similarly sized and similarly priced models? The Edifier MP260 is the cheapest at $70-100, although it&#8217;s not much smaller. The Edifier loses points for sound quality (it sounds more like a small speaker than the rest), and it doesn&#8217;t play nearly as loud. It&#8217;s amplifier supplies 1 watt RMS to each driver while the Klipsch supplies 5 watts RMS to both drivers. Its design is probably the ugliest of all the speakers. Connection is fairly simple, but it&#8217;s not always successful, which can be frustrating. It&#8217;s about half the price of the Gig, but I&#8217;m not sure that it&#8217;s even half as good as the Gig.The Bose SoundLink ($200) is the speaker is similar in terms of sound quality, although Bose&#8217;s sonic signature is more focused on brightness and treble. The gig emphasizes bass, and it sounds meaty, but the Bose puts more emphasis on midrange and treble. This is good if you like acoustic music (e.g., jazz, classical, folk), but not as good for other styles. It&#8217;s also good if you&#8217;re middle-aged or older. We naturally lose sensitivity to upper frequencies as we age, so the brightness of the Bose actually ends up offsetting it. What sounds way too bright to me sounds perfect to my mom. Be honest with yourself and check out the Bose if you&#8217;re over 50.The Jawbone Jambox ($150-200) certainly has an interesting design and it comes in many pretty colors. Jawbone doesn&#8217;t supply many specs for their products (you&#8217;re more likely to find out about color pairings and fashion accessories than frequency response if you visit their website), but they do say that the output rating is 85 decibels. This is certainly fine for this size, but the Klipsch offers 95 dB, which is a meaningful difference. The audio fidelity is decent on the Jambox, but not impressive.OverallIn terms of absolute quality, the Klipsch Gig is the winner. It sounds great, it&#8217;s well designed, it&#8217;s got the longest battery life, and it comes with good accessories. In terms of value, if you don&#8217;t mind sacrificing some bass presence, power, and clarity, the Jambox is a decent deal, if you can find it for $150. The Edifier should only be considered if you&#8217;re on a budget. It&#8217;s a nice little speaker, but it can&#8217;t compete in terms of sonics or power with the rest of the pack. Finally, the Bose is nice if you&#8217;re over 50 and have a small amount of natural hearing loss. Overall, I highly recommend the Klipsch. I&#8217;m very pleased with it, and as someone who has been extremely skeptical about the quality of this relatively new class of tiny, self-powered speaker, the fact that I actually enjoy listening to the Klipsch Gig is impressive in and of itself.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417QXrwiiIL._SX300_.jpg

I&#8217;ve been disappointed before, but thankfully, that is not the case here; quite the opposite, actually. The Brainwavz S1 headphones are pretty awesome, especially for the price!I own and routinely use all sorts of headphones from high end Etymotics canalphones to Apple earbuds to mid-fi Grados to top-of-the-line Sennheisers playing through a dedicated headphone amp. All of those headphones have their place in my collection because all serve a very different purpose. What I was missing, however, was something that was better than the Apple earbuds but not as expensive and touchy as the Etymotics canalphones. I love my Etymotics canalphones, but they require a quality headphone amplifier to achieve proper bass response, and they&#8217;re way too expensive to use casually at, say, the gym. Enter the S1s.The S1s are well constructed and feel durable enough to withstand normal use in a way that my Etymotics are not. The rubber casing of the cable is very flexible, but also seems to provide a good level of protection. This seems trivial, but when you&#8217;re used to dealing with the tiny, delicate wires in an pair of Etymotics, a more durable cabling system is a pretty big deal.The S1s are also interesting insofar as they use an over-the-ear design. This seems to help with the inevitable mircophonics that you get with any headphones that you stick deep in your ear. If you achieve a proper seal, then you&#8217;re going to get some microphonics when you move around. But, the S1s do a decent job of minimizing this.Brainwavz provides a nice carrying case so that you can toss them in a backpack or something without worrying about them being crushed. They also provide a large range of ear tips. There are some single flange and some triple flange options, each in a variety of sizes. This is nice because if you can&#8217;t get a good seal, you&#8217;re not going to get good bass response.For actual listening, I tested these in the way in which I expect most people will use them: powered by a portable device playing compressed music. I also tried listening to uncompressed audio through my computer as well as listening to vinyl through my headphone amp. In each case, the S1s performed very well. At this level, you&#8217;re not gaining much by powering them through a high end headphone amp, so I won&#8217;t say much about that experience other than it was totally fine.Most of my testing involved my iPhone. My Etymotics canalphones just don&#8217;t work with my iPhone at all. Their impedance is way too high and my phone can&#8217;t supply enough voltage to make them sound good. The S1s have an insanely low impedance (16 ohms) and a high sensitivity rating (93 dB at 1mW), so you can basically power these with a mean look! Basically, this is all to say that the S1s will sound great powered by your portable device.I was very pleased with the tonal balance. I prefer a very natural sound without the sort of enhanced bass that the Beats by Dr. Dre headphones are famous for. If you want artificially heavy bass, there are plenty of options. If you want a good, natural representation of the entire frequency range, then check these out. The bass was plentiful, but not overly pronounced. The midrange was smooth and allowed these headphones to sound good even when playing acoustic music. This is another common problem: headphones designed for heavy bass make other styles of music (like &#8220;classical,&#8221; jazz, and folk) sound awful. The naturalness of the sonic contour allows the S1s to sound good playing virtually any style of music. The highs were bright, but never brittle. There was a good amount of sonic detail present in the upper registers.Here, now, is the downside to the S1s. Overall, the dynamic range wasn&#8217;t amazing. If you listen very intently, everything sounds kind of flat, as if all the instruments exist on the same physical plane. You don&#8217;t get the same sense of space with these that you get with a higher impedance headphone like the Etymotics. This isn&#8217;t a huge fault, especially when you factor in the price. And, it becomes almost irrelevant when you consider that most people are going to listen to compressed MP3s through these headphones. This means that you&#8217;re already missing so much sonic detail, that any shortfalls of the S1s are imperceptible anyway due to the poor quality of your sound files. This is a legitimate complaint, but it&#8217;s not an important one, provided you&#8217;re not expecting these to give you a transcendent audiophile listening experience.Overall, the Brainwavz S1s are pretty awesome. They have a nice sound, they do very well with very little power, the bundled accessories are great, and they come with a one-year warranty. Best of all, they provide a huge step up in sound quality from Apple&#8217;s earbuds while remaining within a reasonable price range. If these had some sort of celebrity endorser (like Dr. Dre), Brainwavz would be selling these for twice the price. Instead, they&#8217;re a terrific value. These aren&#8217;t the most amazingly perfect audiophile headphones on the planet, but they are extremely good, particularly if you use them in the scenarios described above. I highly recommend them!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41sKJEPBc5L._SY300_.jpg

I&#8217;ve had a fairly nice Samsung for years, and I always always happy with the picture quality, but the LG is even nicer, I think. The picture is brilliant, clear, bright - pretty much everything you want in a TV. The colors seem natural. It works in all light levels. The viewing angles are impressive. It basically looks the same no matter where you position yourself.  I have absolutely no complaints.I&#8217;ve noticed some reviewers commenting on uneven backlighting, weird color artifacts, and some sort of dimming issues. I&#8217;ve not experienced any of these. The picture looks great all the way to the edges. The TV will change the brightness level of the backlight in accordance with the ambient light of the room, and this can be annoying. The solution is easy: if you turn off the energy saving feature, the screen maintains a constant backlight level, and the dimming issues go away. You&#8217;re using more energy, but the picture is consistent.Sound Quality -Does anyone seriously use the built-in TV speakers? I see people complaining about the TV speakers, but common - don&#8217;t blame the LG. I&#8217;ve never seen a TV with good built-in speakers. They play loud enough to be usable, but they&#8217;re not amazing. Who cares. It&#8217;s like complaining that the speakers on your laptop don&#8217;t have enough bass.Remote -The remote is pretty cool. Instead of limiting you to a four-direction arrow key thing, you get a wii-mote-style cursor that allows you to click wherever you want. This is really nice because it saves you so many clicks when navigating menus. It&#8217;s probably cool for some games as well, although I haven&#8217;t purchased any from the apps store. If you have a Wii or a second generation Roku, you know what to expect. The remote is slightly more responsive than the Roku remote and the cursor moves a bit faster.Of course, if you don&#8217;t like using the cursor, you can use to the knob in the center kind of like a tiny track ball. You can press it to scroll, and you can move it side-to-side. There is a voice activation feature, but this is usually more trouble than it&#8217;s worth.The only downside to the remote is that it&#8217;s so unique that if you want to use a fancy universal remote with your TV, you lose some cool functionality. Thus, you&#8217;ll need to have at least two remotes for your AV system. It&#8217;s not a big deal to me - I don&#8217;t mind switching remotes - but it is to people like my parents who love their single remote system.Menus -The menu system on TVs varies greatly. The Samsung menus are pretty basic, but you have to click through a lot of submenus to get what you want. The Sony menus are a bit better, but not by much. The LG gives you a horizontal list that pops up anytime you hit the home button. My complaint here is that I would like to rearrange the menu items. I rarely watch things on Hulu, and yet it&#8217;s always my second option. It&#8217;s way more common that I watch a Blu-ray movie, but this means I have to move to a second screen to see the option. Other than that, I find the menu system to be very intuitive. Without reading the manual, I was able to navigate to any feature I wanted on the first try. As long as you have a typical amount of GUI intuition, you&#8217;ll find the menu system to be logical and user-friendly.Hardware/Software -My parents use a Sony system where everything runs through the Blu-ray player. It&#8217;s a nice, simple AV hub, but it feels a bit sluggish when compared to, say, a PC. It takes a few seconds for various things like Netflix to load, and it takes a bit of time to power on. The LG is surprisingly spritely. Startup takes maybe 10 seconds, but once the TV is going, the apps load quickly. Netflix pops right up, as does Hulu, YouTube, and whatever else you try.Interestingly, the LG keeps apps running in the background, which allows you to switch between video sources quickly. Say you&#8217;re watching Netflix, but you want to check out a YouTube video. Hit the home button, navigate to YouTube, return to the home menu, and Netflix appears in your recent apps section so that you can pick up right where you left off. This is way cooler than the Sony system where you have to completely exit Netflix to do anything else.Each app works a bit differently. The YouTube app is the worst by far because instead of giving you a grid of characters, you get a single row of letters. Searching takes forever. However, this is not, as some have claimed, LGs fault. Apparently, YouTube supplies electronics manufacturers with their own software. The LG YouTube interface is exactly the same as on my parents&#8217; Sony and my old Samsung. Fortunately, YouTube allows you to pair the TV with your smartphone or computer very easily, so you can bypass the apps annoying features entirely.3D -I think 3D is a gimmick. I don&#8217;t like paying extra for 3D in theaters, and I don&#8217;t care to pay extra for 3D blu-ray discs. Whatever. It&#8217;s my prejudice. The TV works just fine though. I don&#8217;t have enough bandwidth to stream 3D movies through Netflix (although it&#8217;s possible to do so), so my experience is limited to Blu-ray discs and HD broadcasts. Playing through Blu-ray looks amazing. The TV will simulate a 3D effect for HD broadcast input. I don&#8217;t get many stations over the air, but I did watch part of an episode of Ellen (it was all that was on the afternoon that I tried it), and it actually looked kind of decent. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;d do every day, but it&#8217;s a fun gimmick to show friends. The glasses are just regular, 3D glasses like you&#8217;d wear at in a movie theater. No batteries required. You get two pairs, and extra pairs are kind of expensive. You could always just hold onto the 3D glasses you get next time you&#8217;re at the local multiplex.The only thing to keep in mind is that if you&#8217;re hoping to stream 3D movies through Netflix, you&#8217;ll need a lot of bandwidth. I pay for 5GB/sec from AT&T;, but realistically, they never give me more than 756k/sec, and that&#8217;s not enough. Make sure you are getting more like 1.5g/sec if you want to use this feature.Mirroring / Sharing / Pairing -Screen sharing is available via Miracast. I have Apple products, and they use Airplay. It&#8217;s not a huge deal because I can just connect through my AppleTV. If you have an Android device, you should have the functionality built in. I had a friend test it out, and he was able to connect very easily.Setup -Setup was a breeze, although it helps to have two people. Some TVs allow you to set up the base, which the monitor part slides onto. The LG involves screwing in two feet, so you kind of need someone to hold the monitor while driving the screws.Once you power it on, the software setup is fast, intuitive, and easy. An animated penguin character guides you through various steps. It&#8217;s mostly graphical, so you don&#8217;t have to read any obscure instructions or decode any jargon. It&#8217;s quite easy.Design -The appearance of the TV itself is difficult to comment on because with the incredibly narrow bezel, the frame virtually disappears. Essentially, it looks like a big plane of black glass until you turn it on. The minimal design works very well. It has taken me a little while to get used to the apparent lack of a bezel because I&#8217;m used to seeing the image framed by a black rectangle, while with the LG, the picture appears to go all the way to the edge, in a manner of speaking.Overall -Overall, I&#8217;m very pleased with the LG. It&#8217;s the nicest, best looking, most full-featured TV I&#8217;ve ever owned. At this point, I have no substantive complaints. Everything works as it is supposed to. Everything looks beautiful. If something changes, I&#8217;ll update the review. For now though, I&#8217;m going to get back to watching movies!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VkgsYGW5L._SX300_.jpg

I have used the built-in iSight camera on my Macbook Pro a few times, but since I don&#8217;t have a camera built into the monitor on my desktop, I hadn&#8217;t really explored what was out there.The iSight is a pretty decent camera, especially for its size, but it&#8217;s nothing compared to the Logitech C930e. This is a huge step up from any webcam I had previously used. The video quality is amazing, even in low light settings. The autofocus works well, although it gets confused sometimes if you have a lot of movement across multiple planes. And the device really is plug-and-play. You&#8217;ll need to use Logitech&#8217;s software to get the most out of the C930e, but my Mac immediately recognized the device and within seconds I was looking at pristine video.This is technically a &#8220;business&#8221; webcam, and I have no idea what that means. Maybe &#8220;non-business&#8221; webcams have weird novelty features like digital effects or whatever. I suppose if you want gimmicks, you should look elsewhere. Since I don&#8217;t know what makes a webcam &#8220;business oriented,&#8221; I can&#8217;t really comment on that aspect. For me, this is just a webcam. It works really well, the picture quality is outstanding, the color seems natural, and it&#8217;s easy to use.Overall, I can highly recommend the Logitech C930e. It&#8217;s not the most inexpensive webcam out there, but if you need a high level of performance, this is a great choice.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YIJ4pSBVL._SY300_.jpg

Only suggestion I would make is to buy some kind of roofing caulk to use beneath the mounting plate where the screws may penetrate your roof.  I think I also bought other bolts to mount the bracket on my roof (not sure).  Great antenna for the price considering that it comes with the bracket and mounting plate (some I saw priced as much as this entire package).,4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31yDc05FkzL._SY300_.jpg
