This story messed with my brain!Yes this is ultimately about the love between a brother and sister, but there is so much more than that.I felt so deeply for this family of five children, especially Lochan. He was carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders and it was breaking him. It was breaking me reading it.Even with all the sadness and heartbreaking moments I wasn't crying tears! :(I made it all the way to 85% and then the dam broke!!I was flabbergasted at what was happening and was kicking myself for wondering where my tears had previously been. They caught up to me and didn't stop until the very last sentence. More than once I gasped in shock while continuing to cry.I woke up the next morning immediately thinking of what happened and why???!!!Why did it have to happen this way?

Ethan, Beau, Blake, Zane, Zoey, Travis, Gage, Kylie, V, Sawyer, Kaleb, Brendon, Braydon, Jared, Curtis. Who? What?Of course, as things progressed I got bits and pieces of what was in the other books and who everyone was. It turned out fine.. but if I had to do it over again, I'd probably have read the others first so I had a better understanding of everyone's back story.The same can be said for both Ethan and Beau.

As a matter of fact I was expecting it!!How did I get so lucky to receive an advanced copy?? Bless you A.L.

He was always taking care of Aly, watching over her and loving her. I LOVED the way he would hold onto a piece of her hair!! So sweet!Jared now is a broken and damaged man. He isn&#8217;t worthy of love, friendship, trust or even a happy life. At least that&#8217;s how he sees himself. He is in purgatory and must pay for his sins!Aly is beautiful, sweet and pure. She embodies everything he cannot have. She also reminds him every day of his past life. How it felt to be loved, happy and carefree.He struggles with his feelings, wanting her and knowing there's no way in hell he can have her.Despite the shocking tragedies and tortured character, I found the story sweet and easy going. The shock and tears came much later in the story, almost at the end. That's when she hits you with it all at once!Not a cliffhanger per say... but you are sort of left hangin'!Can't wait to find out where the journey leads in Come to Me Softly.*I received an advanced copy provided by A.L.

I noticed a few mistakes here and there, but they didn&#8217;t take away from the story any.And lastly, honestly I think the last chapter was unnecessary. The story could have ended with chapter 18 and I would have been perfectly content.Recap- hot and steamy, sweet and loving. This was my first Ann Lister book and I look forward to reading more from her!",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519DRhYq7lL.jpg

But she grows on you and just like people in the story you start to understand her and like her.I loved how different this story was. and I hadn't known it was a fairy tale ( or not that I could remember)It had be hooked right from the beginning and wishing that she somehow magically ended up with the scarecrow king.Easy to follow and fall in love with!!! Very PG but I think this story is perfect just the way Jill Myles has written it.INSTANT FAN!Recommend to anyone who enjoys and great and exciting adventure and with a lovely romance to top it all off.I very glad I read this.

It is a bit like a vampire modern day version of Romeo and Juliet if there ever was one.If you don't like stories that leave at a cliff hanger ending then this book may not be for you.Perfect for anyone who lobes Eve Langlais!,5.0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414FMQhxdyL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"

This book! I needed a few days before I wrote my review because seriously... THIS BLEW MY MIND AWAY! When I finished it I was so confused, and excited and speechless. Maggie Stiefvater, she's just amazing. We have yet another book full of magic, possibilities, dreams... And they all seem so real. Maggie once again presented a world where everything is possible, you just have to believe it can be real. Her magic feels real.On The Dream Thieves, the quest for Glendower is still going and it is more intense and confusing since now the ley line is awake. But Blue and her Raven Boys are now facing new threats. They don't know it for sure, but there are other people interested on the ley line and everything that comes along with it. Every single possibility it represents. We have the characters we all know and love, like the Raven Boys and Blue and her family. They're all important, but we also have a few more characters added to the story. And from these new characters, a new ally might appear (well, that's what I think).If you've read the first book, you know this series is full of points of view. In this one we add Ronan's and a few other's POV to the mix. With Ronan... You first meet him as the intense and problematic part of the group. On this book, you understand where his anger comes from. The story behind his dad's death. How he feels towards some people (people who I won't mention, but let me tell you... I KNEW IT). He's discovering who and what he is, what he's capable of. Also, who's like him or appears to be like him, and the part they play with the ley line.Then we have Adam. Adam, the responsible for waking up the ley line. The one who's changing and doesn't understand why and what's happening to him. He's so angry all the time. I don't really like him. I didn't like him on the first book and I didn't like him on this one. He's too resentful and I hate how he makes Gansey feel. Like he's to blame for everything. I understand, his life hasn't been easy, he wants more for him, but there are ways to do it. Getting help is not a bad thing.Blue and Gansey... There wasn't enough of these two Maggie! Come on. I know this story is not about the romance, it is a part of it, but not all. But come on! This is torture. That scene, THAT SCENE! Oh my God! It was amazing, beautiful, romantic and devastating all at the same time. I need more. Their romance grows slowly. It's not the typical love story. But it's beautiful. Both of them start to realize how much they can rely on each other. How much they actually matter to each other. This was unbelievable.And talking about torture. Dear God woman! What was that last scene? Jesus.The ley line is more than what they all thought at first. It is powerful and unpredictable and full of magic. Every time there's some interaction with it, like some one waking it up, or finding it again or whatever... The ley line is going to respond. If it's going to give them something, the ley line has to take something back.I can't wait to read the next book. I'm already dying to have it.Congratulations Maggie Stiefvater for another great book",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R01tTjjtL.jpg

That made me so sad and so mad sooooo many times, not at the book of course, but at the situation.The characters were amazing, I'm so impressed because I fell in love with every single one of them, with the exception of one, of course (the mother), but the rest of them were so full of love and compassion and tolerance, it was incredible. They're incredibly real. Caroline is just a girl, but has to go through so many things, she has to grow up pretty fast. And after everything, she still manages to love and trust people. She definitely has a good heart.Isaiah.. I just loved him. Everything he felt he said it and he used to say the sweetest things. I just felt every word he said.

I&#8217;ll explain.This is the story of Josie Sommers, a girl who&#8217;s had a rough life, having to live one traumatic experience by the hands of a monster and being saved by her angel and best friend all in one night. She&#8217;s been heartbroken by two guys she loved. She&#8217;s been lied to and has lied too. When she starts a new college with her two best friends, after spending one year in community college, she&#8217;s hoping to get her degree and keep moving on with her life. Because that&#8217;s what she does. She moves on. But things won&#8217;t go that easy. She meets Blake. Blake Porter. He&#8217;s sweet, he&#8217;s different, she feels safe around him. But all that won&#8217;t matter when she finds out the truth about him and his family. What can you do when the one you love has been lying to you for years? What can you do when that secret will keep you away from the one you love? I guess, you stay strong and move on.My thoughts:First, let me tell you why I liked the book. The way the story is written is really interesting, I really liked the going back and forth writing. It wasn&#8217;t confusing at all, which can happen pretty easily with this kind of writing. The characters were all relatable, they felt real, which is always a +1000, because there&#8217;s nothing more boring than a book with un realistic characters. This is a story about strength, moving on, discovering yourself, truth, honesty, facing your fears. Not letting life take you down. The story includes several real and difficult situations, situations that can be hard to get over or move on from. But there&#8217;s a sense of wanting. I&#8217;ve read several books that include these types of situations, but the girl usually tends to just shut down from her family, friends and life in general. This is not the case. And I liked that.Now my issues with the book. I thought there were soooo many unnecessary scenes. It felt like they were just trying to fill up the blanks that weren&#8217;t even there. I have to be honest, at the end, I just skipped a few pages. It got to the point where Jossie and Blake were just doing one thing. I mean, what bothered me was that their conversations got shorter, fewer. It stopped meaning something, you know? The story would&#8217;ve felt a lot more focused on what was really going on if it hadn&#8217;t had so many what I thought were meaningless (to the plot) sex scenes.The characters:Now the characters. First we have Jossie. She&#8217;s one of the strongest characters I&#8217;ve read. She believes in herself. Yes, she has her moments of self doubt, anyone can have those, but, she&#8217;s been through so much her entire life, that those moments are really very few. She has her mind set, every time something happens to her, she knows she has to get back up. She has to move on, and that&#8217;s exactly what she does. She&#8217;s a complete survivor, but she doesn&#8217;t just survives, she has learned how to deal with abuse, death, heartbreaks. Every kind of loss. I didn&#8217;t like some of her decisions, some of them were really all about her, she was being selfish. She was kind of selfish with Blake and with Seth. I believe she made a huge mistake. I think, towards the end, she was just too desperate, but I didn&#8217;t like (at all) her rushed decisions. It&#8217;s just my opinion though. I totally agree with Blake&#8217;s reaction.Now the boys. Well, this gets kind of confusing for me because.. I wasn&#8217;t sure who I liked better. Sometimes I was team Blake, no doubt. But then&#8230; I was hoping Seth would have a chance with Jossie, a real chance. (You get my confusion?) I really can&#8217;t say who I like better. I know who&#8217;s the one for her, that&#8217;s very clear. I&#8217;ll just keep on wishing&#8230;Blake, he&#8217;s the sweet, protective guy. He loves with passion and intensity. He&#8217;s strong, he knows how to treat Jossie, how to make her feel special. He&#8217;s attentive, considerate. He won&#8217;t ask more questions than he should. He just knows exactly what to do to make Jossie feel safe and loved.Seth on the other hand&#8230; He is Jossie&#8217;s savior, her best friend, her first love. He&#8217;ll do anything for Jossie. But he&#8217;s a man whore. The guy can keep it in. Of course, that&#8217;s because all he wants to do is forget the best friend he knows he won&#8217;t ever have. Not like he wants to anyway. He&#8217;s screwed up his chance once. And he&#8217;ll probably never get another, but I think he&#8217;s the kind of friend that sticks around, because what matters most to him is having Jossie, in any way he can.So, this story is not a 3 stars kind of story. But, since I had those little problems, it isn&#8217;t a 4 stars either. It could&#8217;ve been. The story has a new kind of twist. Some things can be seen from the start, yes&#8230; but there are other that you don&#8217;t expect. I&#8217;m really interested in reading more about this story and these characters. Will Seth have another chance? Will Blake forgive Jossie?",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vJaYTkK5L.jpg

Let&#8217;s get something out of the way.. TRAVIS IS BACK! Yaaaay.. I was so happy when I heard there was going to be another book with Travis on it :).That said.. Let&#8217;s talk about the book.A beautiful wedding is the story of Travis and Abby&#8217;s weeding. How and why they did it, who knew about it and how they felt about it :). After going through all that mess with the fire and all those deaths, they decided to go to Vegas one more time and get married.At first, I was a bit worried about Abby&#8217;s reasons, because even though they were valid and came out of pure concern about Travis, they kind of took away the romantic gesture that was created on the first book. So I was kind of scared that the book would turn out to be a disappointment. But at the end, was it &#8216;crazy? Yes. Wrong? No.&#8217;I think this book is just &#8216;the story after the happy ending&#8217;, well kind of. Here you get to see they were both nervous, they both had reasons to do it, and they both were happy to do it. Travis was exceptionally excited, I thought it was so cute how he was all nervous and happy, but scared at the same time that she would freak out and leave him again, or that it was just all a dream. Because all he wanted was to be with Abby.Abby, was all business at first. She had a mission to accomplish and she wouldn&#8217;t leave until it was done. But then, her head was getting in the way. She was, in fact, freaking out. She just needed a little push and of course, Travis, knowing he was doing it or not, helped her. He gave her something so valuable and important, she knew what she had and wanted to do. His mother&#8217;s letter was all the push she needed. I think it was in that moment she knew it was more than just about saving Travis, it was about being with the person who loved you the most. It was about getting a happy ending.&#8220;When a Maddox boy falls in love, he loves forever&#8221;I loved that letter.On BD and WD, these two had to face a lot of ups and downs, but it only made them stronger as a couple, even the time they were apart. It just helped them understand they were perfect for each other. They were good for each other.&#8220;This thing might turn out to be a completely wonderful, beautiful disaster, but I want that if that sits with you.&#8221;The story about Travis and Abby is just wonderful. I love how they found and saved each other. The writing in this book was as good as it was with the other two. How their feelings are described.. It kind of feels like your part of the whole story, and I love that. This is a good book, not as good as the first two were, but only because the drama in this one isn&#8217;t as intense as in the other two. Aside. That, I think the story was good and cute. Enough to make me happy :).",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51oXik7WcWL.jpg

At first, I was super excited because I liked the first book so much. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I liked this one too, just not as much. I get this is like a transition kind of book, but it was kind of slow for my taste. I still enjoyed it though.In this book, you get to see Roseline and Gabriel grow a little bit more as characters, the same goes with Nicolae. Here, the characters get to have a development a little more profound since it&#8217;s some kind of quest. Everyone is trying to figure out the truth, what their destiny truly is. But as they get farther and farther in this discovery, some new threats come along.About the story:Ok, well like I said, I really enjoyed the book. It took me a while to finish it since I haven&#8217;t had that much time to read. The thing that was kind of a disappointment was the slow pace of the book, but other than that, it was good. We have a major separation here, it was so frustrating, but Amy manages to keep the book mysterious enough to keep you reading. There are new characters, some I liked and some I was super suspicious about (and with good reasons). Like I said, Reckoning is like a transition book, here you get a few more answers about what&#8217;s going on&#8230; You get to understand a little more the Immortal world and Roseline and Gabriel&#8217;s bond.There&#8217;s some action, which was pretty good actually. Here, Roseline is the badass I always knew she was. No body messes with her and the ones she loves. She gets and will get her revenge on everyone who has hurt her in some way or another. She&#8217;s a lot more determined in this book. There are some twists I liked, like the explanation of what the Immortals really are (I won&#8217;t say much about it) and the end. I wasn&#8217;t really expecting it, I mean, sure&#8230; I knew something was up, but I wasn&#8217;t expecting THAT, so it kind of took me by surprise.About the characters:Ok so, since we don&#8217;t get to see that much of Gabriel and Roseline as a couple, we get to know them separately, which is good. Even though I already knew a little bit more about Roseline from the first book, here you get to know Gabriel, his point of view, his feelings, his doubts, his strengths, which are not that specific in the first book. He&#8217;s the sort of guy who&#8217;ll do anything for the girl he loves, even if it means leaving her behind today, to save her later. I love him. He&#8217;s sweet and strong and loyal and so many good things, even knowing where he comes from, he&#8217;s still good.Roseline is a awesome badass. I love her. No matter how sad she is, how much pain she has to face, physically and/or emotionally, she will do whatever she has to do to get to the boy she loves. I hope I get to see a lot more of Gabriel and Roseline in the next book, because there was some in the first book, none in the second&#8230; it&#8217;s time for them to be able to be together, don&#8217;t you think? :) She&#8217;s honest. If you hadn&#8217;t seen that in the first book, you&#8217;ll get to see it here. I love that she&#8217;s able to keep her feelings straight. She&#8217;s not one of those female characters that just because she&#8217;s not currently with the boy she loves, she finds &#8220;shelter&#8221; with another guy. Yes, she&#8217;s constantly being comforted by Fane, but she&#8217;s not giving him any false hope to what she wants.Fane&#8230; well, I don&#8217;t care that much about him. I mean, yes, he&#8217;s a true friend to Rose and I appreciate that, BUT to me he&#8217;s the other guy, and you know how I think about that ;)Nicolae&#8230; Nicolae&#8230; Nicolae! I like him. I like his stubbornness, his strength, his loyal qualities. He has become a really good friend to Roseline.I can&#8217;t wait to continue this story &#60;3",3.0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/513Ktk2MmqL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"

I read this book like 4 months ago and I still have a book hangover. It's THAT GOOD. Every day I get reminded of this story in one way or the other. I just can't get over it and I don't really want to &#60;3Oh, I just love books that make me smile... Even though I spent a lot of the time I was reading this book mad at Nate.. There were some parts that had my heart jumping up and down!This first book introduces you to Emi and Nate's friendship, which is clearly more than just that, although they just won't admit it. They laugh and they fight, but they always find their way to each other, thank God because I died a little every time they had a fight. My thoughts on their relationship is that, sure, it's not easy to jump to the unknown, especially when you know the risks of doing it. So I understood where both of them were coming from, BUT, if you don't take risks, how are you really going to find out if things will work out or not? sometimes you just have to have faith that it will.The story was beautifully written, it was well paced and I felt every feeling there is, from frustration, anger and sadness to happiness and giddiness. The characters were just perfect. Let's start with Nate... He messed up a lot. He made a lot of mistakes. But still, he had my heart from the very start. I loved him with his flaws and all and I still do. He was this sweet guy, he was intense, he was passionate, full of so many pure emotions. He's definitely one character you'll never forget, I know I never will. It was obvious how much he cared about Emi, but he didn't know what to do with his feelings, especially since he didn't feel like he was worthy of her. That's never good. And besides, after all, he always had good intentions. He just wanted to have a nice life, he knew it could be better with Emi, but that's something he was sure was never going to happen, so he had to settle with something, right? Ahm, no.Emi on the other hand, she knows what she wants. She wants her dreamy happily ever after, and she's determined to get it. But let's get something straight... Life's hard and relationships are even harder, especially when you're not honest with yourself and how you feel. But anyway... I loved her! Even when Nate was being a complete ass, she was good to him, but not because she was a pushover or stupid.. No, I think she just knew how important and good they were to each other. Besides, she stood up to him when she really had to. I really liked her, she's so good and sweet and kind of naive, so... I could relate to her.Oh, and this... This made me smile, then made me cry, but still.. It made me smile. I loved Nate even more with this (if that's even possible).&#34;Hi, little one,Thirteen years, one night.Nine months. One small baby will deliver true love.I can't wait to see you.&#34;And that ending... I knew it was coming, I had been expecting it for so loooooong, and still... It shocked me! (I loved Nate sooo much those last few pages) I can't wait to read the second book!!!!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-ziCQwSpL.jpg

Roseline Dragomir, is now Roseline Enescue. When she was 17 years old, was forced into marrying Vladimir Enescue, and that dreadful day ended up turning into a massacre. Everyone she cared about was killed by Vladimir&#8217;s and Lucien&#8217;s (his brother) hands, and that same day she was reborn. Now, she&#8217;s 300 years old. After a few failed attempts at escaping, now she finds her chance. She manages to leave Bran Castle and she&#8217;s not planning to ever go back.My thoughts:So, the plot turned out to be really interesting. The story of Roseline&#8217;s life isn&#8217;t that specific, I mean, we don&#8217;t get a look at how it is at Bran Castle, how Vladimir treats her, we just get glimpses of it, what she&#8217;s been through during all those 300 years living there. It&#8217;s obvious how much she despises her life there and her &#8220;husband&#8221;, and she can only trust and feel safe around one person there, her best friend Fane. But that&#8217;s not enough, she needs out. She wants to be free of that torturous monster. I read somewhere that the character wasn&#8217;t badass enough. I have to disagree there, I mean yeah, the girl isn&#8217;t the typical I&#8217;m-gonna-kick-your-ass kind of girl, at least not always, but she was a pretty strong character to me.So, Roseline finally gets out. She goes to America to find some peace from her old life, what she wasn&#8217;t expecting was to make friends and fall in love. And that&#8217;s what scares her the most. Falling for a human is forbidden. Her relationship with Gabriel was something special. It&#8217;s obvious Roseline is fighting with all she has to stay away, but the pull is just too strong. I liked the way their relationship was described. It didn&#8217;t feel like it was too fast or too exaggerated. The connection between them was instant, yes, but their relationship was not. So you get the chance to see a development in their love story. The story itself was really well paced and nicely written. I really enjoyed it.The characters:So, I felt for Roseline from the start. The girl hates being what she is and what had to be done to make her an Immortal and she may not have stood up for herself during those 300 years in front of Vladimir, but I understand why she didn&#8217;t. The guy is a monster. And, to be fair, to have to go through all that torture and still be brave enough to try to escape&#8230; That&#8217;s pretty badass to me. I understood the way she acted when she got to Chicago, she wanted to stay under the radar but trouble kept finding her. And by trouble I mean Gabriel &#60;3. I liked how she felt about him, even though she kep running away from him. She was just trying to keep herself safe.Gabriel, Gabriel, Gabriel. Oh I like you. He&#8217;s honest. He&#8217;s impulsive. He&#8217;s strong and he&#8217;s open minded. I liked how he was always telling Rose how he felt, even though she wouldn&#8217;t tell him anything back. I loved how he would risk anything to help Roseline. Yes, he acted like a jerk sometimes, but he&#8217;s a guy. They can be pretty infuriating sometimes (haha).Then we have Fane. Oh Fane, I&#8217;m not sure about you yet. You&#8217;re the other guy of the story so (or that&#8217;s who I think you are).. I&#8217;m sorry, but by default I don&#8217;t like you. I didn&#8217;t like his attitude towards Roseline, I understand where he&#8217;s coming from but I don&#8217;t know. Let&#8217;s see how this goes when I start the second book ;).I already one-clicked the box set, so let&#8217;s see how that goes. I&#8217;m pretty excited about it!",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/512vuH2BFoL.jpg

Wow, I never thought this series was going to affect me as much as it did. I was truly enthralled by the story and the characters. This series is now one of my absolute favorites.First of all, I'd like to say that I loved how each book is from a different POV. First you get to know Nate. Nate who is an amazing guy, devoted, passionate, creative, adorable, sweet, and the list goes on. Then we get to know Emi a little better, but in this second book, you get to really know her, how she thinks and reacts. And then.. We get Jack. He's such a good guy, you can't help but like him and even love him. So, the fact that you can get to know these three characters as individuals makes the whole story a lot better. You can relate to all three of them. Well, I did anyway.About the book. Well, in book 2 I knew Jack loved Emi. He was so sweet to her and considerate and reliable. It was obvious he was completely in love with her. But, in this book you know, for certain how important she really is to him. Sure, he truly was her rock, her stability. And all of this was tested when new complications appeared. Emi's life wasn't an easy one, but Jack stayed, he helped her get through it when no one else could. The only other person who could've helped her, wasn't there. So I guess, no, I know, Jack was good for Emi and maybe, after everything that happened, he was the one for her. (But hey, don't get the wrong idea, I'm only saying this because Nate wasn't in the picture).I loved the last couple of chapters. Especially the one where they meet Livvy. I'm sad I didn't get to know her a little better, but I guess I'll have to read the Choisie series for that :).I'm sorry I'm not that much of a fan of Jack. I'm too attached to Nate. It's not that I don't like or love him, it's just that my mind and heart was (still is) set on Nate.Oh, I wanted to add something else. The writing of these three books is amazing. From the first book it captures you and can't stop reading. Every little detail is amazingly described. Each character has his/her own personality, which are great, and the story's development is perfect.I still miss Nate. &lt;3",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51WTPnIH-RL.jpg

Especially if you are a Nate fan :). This makes up for everything, I promise.Wow! I can't believe how happy this book has made me, especially since I've been so sad with all that happened on book 1 and 2. I had a smile on my face while I was reading this, but I guess that's what Nate does! :):):):):) I was dying to read this. This was going to bring Nate back. So, thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!! Because it totally did. &#60;3This book describes how Emi and Nate met and how they became friends. They were both going through some difficult situations, but somehow, they found each other. Nate was what Emi needed, and Emi was what Nate needed. I loved how comfortable they were with each other, even from the first time they met. It was easy for them, they could relate, they found truth and love in each other. I just LOVED it.Nate, oh Nate. How I've missed you. It's not fair this book is so short. But then again, I would read a single page just to have Nate back. Here you see how he meets Emi, how he starts to like her and how he falls in love with her. Just in a matter of days, but it doesn't really matter, because what he feels for Emi is completely true and different. She inspires him. She makes him a better person. And he makes her a better person too.&#34;For the first time in my life, I understand what people mean when they talk about artists having their muses. Maybe she's mine.&#34;So, after reading all the books and some posts on Lori Otto's page, I understand that maybe, in the story, Nate wasn't Emi's &#34;soulmate&#34;. But, I have a hard time accepting it, so... to me he'll always be her soulmate. And she'll always be his :). And that's that.&#34;Not today, but someday, I will fight for her. I know what I have to do. When she's ready for love, I'll fight for her.&#34;I'm sure I'll read this particular book and Lost & Found again in the future.

After experiencing a traumatic event a couple of years ago without receiving the proper help from her parents, she decided that it was best to shut down completely. Leaving all deep and meaningful conversations with her family and friends aside. Until she meets Nate. The guy who&#8217;s been living in her garage for who knows how long. They both have secrets they don&#8217;t want to share, but as they start to get to know each other, their trust grows so it becomes easier for Hanley to share what&#8217;s really going on with her. Especially when he seems to be the only person who truly understands her.I&#8217;ll start by saying I liked this book. The plot and the characters were pretty entertaining. First you have Hanley, you don&#8217;t know much at first about what happened to her, but you know something happened. It&#8217;s not hard to guess what that was, at least it was not for me. She&#8217;s angry, sad and the guilt is killing her. So she tends to find her escape in alcohol and parties, that way she can find some peace and forget her past, at least for a little while. She&#8217;s stubborn as hell and she&#8217;ll rather lie to her parents than to make them (or herself) face the truth about what&#8217;s going on with her life. Then we have Nate, the runaway kid. We don&#8217;t know much about him at first, just that he&#8217;s clearly hiding something. Something big. But his secrets can&#8217;t be as bad if he&#8217;s this sweet guy, right? Yes, he&#8217;s a sweet, funny guy. Even though his situations is kind of weird and suspicious, you know he&#8217;s good. So I liked him a lot. And he seemed truly worried about Hanley&#8217;s well being, even from the start.So, yes, I liked this book, but&#8230; Not enough to give it a 4 or 5 star, hence the 3.5. Let me explain my rating.This is a fast and light book and it kind of intrigued me at the beginning, but as the story went on.. the magic kind of disappeared. The book gets too predictable, and even though lately we all know or can assume how a lot of books will turn out, the way the situations are described makes the story believable and real, you know? Of course, there are some things you might think about when you&#8217;re reading this book, such as &#8220;why would someone let a stranger live in your garage?&#8221; or &#8220;no one reacts like that when you find some dude living in your garage&#8221;, etc. But, let&#8217;s put that aside, and think&#8230; This is a book, some of the reactions may not be too realistic, but it&#8217;s just a book. There are weirder ways for a book character to meet and fall in love with another character. In this case, it didn&#8217;t bother me. What did bother me was that I kind of felt like, since the story was coming to an end, it had to increase its pace, so it didn&#8217;t go so smoothly. Like, all of the sudden there were all these revelations (Hanley&#8217;s, Nate&#8217;s parents, Hanley&#8217;s parents&#8230;) and they all were like &#8220;OMG, I can see clearly now!&#8221;, so after being mad for a long time, people just forgive everyone and move on? Hmm, no. This was what felt like the most unrealistic part of the book. At the end everything seemed kind of forced.",4.0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cb7FUi33L._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"

How do I start this review? Ok, yeah. Saying this book is an emotional roller coaster is an understatement. So, I'll give you a piece of advice, you should buddy read this. Don't do it alone, because you'll need the support. Trust me. I actually read this with a friend of mine, and even so, I was still a mess. Oh, and get a whole box of tissues (or maybe ten).This is the second book of the Emi Lost & Found series, and I have to say, it was a little hard for me to read.. Not because the book was hard to understand, or the characters were unbelievable (well, Emi was sometimes, but for different reasons), or bad or anything like that. No, in fact, it was the entire opposite.Time Stands Still is from Emi's POV, you get to know her a little better, how she deals with every situation she has to face. You get to know her, like her, dislike her, be mad at her and mourn with her. In my case, I was pretty upset with her a great part of the book. Wanna know why? Well, sometimes I just felt she wasn't appreciating her relationship with Nate enough, like she was second-guessing it and just leaving him behind. And come on, Nate's her soulmate. I know it, you know it, everyone knows it. How could she think she was wrong about that? Oh yeah, because of Jack, but I'll talk about him later. So, in my frustrated moment, I asked for some guidance, right? Because I couldn't believe how Emi was acting. So this great and wise woman (thank you Lori L. Otto) told me I had to give Emi a try, be patient with her. And that's what helped me get through this whole situation. I decided Emi has the right to question everything and, eventually, move on. And I know, deep in my heart, she won't forget him. As in ever. And that gives me peace of mind.So, back to Jack. This guy is...wow! He made me feel guilty the whole time, just like Emi felt at the beginning of it all. He was always showing up and doing the sweetest things for Emi. And I liked him (here comes the guilt haha), and that's a whole new thing for me, since (like I've said in other reviews) I don't usually like &#34;the other guy&#34; of the story, but I know this situation is different, so I've allowed myself to actually like him and give him a chance. And why wouldn't I? He's considerate, sweet, patient, adorable and he cares for Emi deeply, you can see it.But still, I love and miss Nate. I don't think I'll put this whole thing behind me any time soon. Every time I remember what happened I start to cry and cry and cry. Like I said, I'm a mess when it comes to my emotions and this book haha.So, overall.. I loved this book. It may sound weird, since I was crying the entire thing, but really, this story is heartbreaking and beautiful at the same time.Thank you Lori, for giving me the chance to meet this beautiful characters and their story &#60;3",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-SidjRJ9L.jpg

I liked the story line a lot, it was completely different and it presented a new kind of way to see the world and love and live in general. It had everything any Colleen Hoover book must have, but I don't know, I didn't love it like I thought I would or like I loved Slammed or Hopeless. Let me explain.The story:Maybe Someday is the story of Sydney and Ridge, how they met, how they fell in love and how they were so right for each other, even when their timing wasn't. When they first met (officially) Sydney was having the worst day, needing to find some place to live, since she was now homeless thanks to her pig ex boyfriend and roommate so Ridge kindly offers her his house. Since the first day they both saw the other one, there has been some kind of connection. Music brought them together but music would also be the cause of their torment.Like I said, this book had something different. Every book by Colleen Hoover will and I love that about her. She always writes about tough situations in a beautiful way. Her writing is just perfect. That's why I was kind of sad whn I finished the book. Even though it included this big twist in the development of the characters, I felt like the book was lacking something. I'm still not sure what it was exactly, but I didn't find that point in the story or the characters that made me say &#34;wow, I'm in love&#34;. With Slammed and Hopeless (I'm talking about them as series), it was instantly. I fell in love with Will and Holder the second they appeared, and not just them.. but how the stoy itself grew.The story was perfectly written. The way she described Ridge's and Sydney's situation, again.. it's so subtle, so COHO. It makes you think of certain things one would take for granted. And some scenes like their first kiss... it was just beautiful. That was one of my favorite parts of the book. Because the whole thing was just so incredibly beautiful. Oh and I just have to say something about the music. The whole experience was just amazing. I did love being able to listen to the songs along with the story. That was so new to me, but it made the whole reading experience an awesome one.But it wasn't enough for me to love the book.The characters:Let's start with Sydney. She's a tough girl. She stood up for herself when she had to. She has a big heart, she's understanding, friendly, honest, and true to her heart. I liked her a lot. She's one of those characters that will do anything for the ones she loves, even if it means her heart will be broken. If doing whatever she has to do will make the other person happy, she'll do it. Which is good, but not always.Then we have Ridge. Ridge was... how do I say it... He was something special. He is nice, he loves in a beautiful way. He teaches you see and feel the world in a new way. He's always trying to do what's right, and that's why he's kind of stuck, even though he doesn't realize it. That is until Sydney shows up. Sometimes, I thought he was just too into his confort zone and he was just afraid to leave it and even though he never wanted to hurt anyone he loved... he ended up doing just that. He just couldn't make up his mind and when he did... it was all for the wrong reasons.I really, really wanted to love it and go crazy about it like I was with Slammed and Hopeless, because thouse books, to me... they were and still are two of my favorites. This won't change my mind on how I feel towards Colleen Hoover's books, I'll read every single one of them :) &#60;3 because she is an amazing author.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/81rCityicgL.jpg

Not that a couple of hours can do much with my recovery process, since I don't think I'll be able to recover, not entirely lol. Anyway, here it goes...Let's start with the story. How to Kill a Rock Star is an amazing book! I seriously recommend it to anyone looking for a love story. Well, this is the story of Eliza, a music journalist, and Paul, a musician with so much talent he could get goose bumps on everyone by only singing for 10 seconds. As he would say, 'that's the difference between the real stuff and the crap.' He was only devoted to his music, his band and Eliza. And she was devoted to him and her work. But of course, happiness doesn't last, because, as Paul said 'happiness is a fleeting condition, not a goddamn state of mind.' , so of course, everything had to go down. The story of these two lovebirds was completely devastating and insanely beautiful, there were some points where I had to stop reading, because my heart couldn't take it, I was feeling everything as if it was happening to me, and for me, that's what makes a book a good one, when the story is so well written and it is so full of emotions, you don't just read it, you live it.Now, the characters. What can I say of Paul and Eliza? First of all, Paul is perfection. He lived for the music he played and the woman he loved. Eliza, even though I hated you, for a long time... I get it! So, no hard feelings. She's a great character and she would do anything to help Paul make it as the musician she knew he was. (Although I still think there were OTHER OPTIONS Eliza, seriously! There goes the &#34;no hard feelings&#34; crap) Other than these two.. There's Loring, Loring Blackman. If you know me, you'll know why I didn't like him, but I have to admit he acted as a true friend to Eliza, never overstepped or tried anything less than honest and decent. So, ok, that gave him some points, but not enough.Oh and Winkle, I can't forget about Winkle, his caterpillar eyebrows and Winkle Records. That made me laugh. Paul sure knew how to drive that man crazy.So yeah, this book will probably make you laugh, cry, sigh, sob, scream in either happiness or frustration. But its a goddamn must read.I would give it 10 stars if I could.Wow.. Just wow. I need time to recover.Over.PS: this book deserves a lot more than 5 stars.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51pUAH59NdL.jpg

At first I thought it was ok-ish, but the more I read, the more the main character frustrated me.At first, all I could think was &#34;why isn't she reporting this?&#34;, the fact that there were underage kids drinking isn't a good excuse. Not for me at least. If you told me the girl was scared because the guy threatened her or something... but no, her first thought was: &#34;I can't report this, I might get my friends in trouble!&#34; Not ok.Now, about the love story. Well, I felt the story didn't have any real depth between Lucas and Jaqueline. I mean, every time they saw each other, they didn't have full conversations, they just crossed a few words, but that was it. They had no self control. So that was an issue for me. I didn't actually see the depth of the relationship.Next, he lied. I get it, I get it, in every book there's a lie or something left unsaid, that becomes the reason why the couple break up or fight.. And that's ok, I mean, that's part of the drama. But in this case, man.. This girl didn't get angry or mad or anything... So, it bothered me that she wouldn't stand up for herself. Not even when the guy she liked/loved lied to her.Last, but not least... I didn't feel like there was that huge OMG moment. The hugeee break up? The hugeee fight between these two? There was none. Every time there was something &#34;worthy&#34; of a fight... well, she just showed up wherever he was and everything was right with the world. Seriously? And then I thought, ok, MAYBE just maybe, the huge fight is not supposed to be between Jackie and Lucas, maybe the real trouble will be caused by Buck. And that would've been ok with me, really... But man, it was SO NOT the case. So, when this guy (Buck) shows up, there's some struggle between him and Jackie, and then Lucas shows up (because he was going after her because they got in this super (not) fight) and beats the crap out of him. AGAIN. And AGAIN everything is just fine.So yeah, there were a lot of things I didn't like. Where was that huge dramatic, traumatic, chaotic, whatever you want to call it, moment? When the world seems to be ending for both, the characters and for you as a reader, so there could be the sweet moment when they finally understand they can't live without each other *sigh* (as corny as it may sound, but admit it, you live for those moments, I know I do). It didn't exist.Actually, I found myself rolling my eyes soooo many times and counting the pages to see how many I had left. It was annoying. (I don't really know why I didn't just drop the book, so don't ask)",1.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51i9boWYM8L.jpg

I started this series at the beginning of 2013, and enjoyed it a lot. Catching Jordan is my number one favorite in this series, followed by Racing Savannah. This is such a sweet, cute and happy reading. If you&#8217;re looking for something light, something to have fun with.. This might be it!Racing Savannah introduces you to Savannah Barrows, a girl who&#8217;s been around horses since she was a little girl. Now, she&#8217;s moved to Cedar Hill Farms, in Franklin, Tennessee, where she&#8217;ll have to start a new life with her dad and his pregnant girlfriend. Oh, and Jack, Jack Goodwin. Owner of the farm (at least for a year). She knows she has to work hard to have a future. A future far away from what she&#8217;s known all her life. She doesn&#8217;t want to end up like her father, working for a min wage. So, she plans on working at the farm as a horse exercise rider. She knows everything about how to treat and take care of horses. She knows what she wants and she&#8217;s going to get it. At least she&#8217;ll give herself a chance to try.This is a lovely story. Like I said, my second favorite of the Hundred Oak Series. Miranda Kenneally knows how to write her stories with a great sense of humor and a great amount of &#8220;drama&#8221;, even though you don&#8217;t get it as the typical end-of-the-world drama. So this is a pretty easy reading. I started it yesterday and a couple of hours later I was halfway through it. It&#8217;s not just that&#8217;s a light reading, it&#8217;s how appealing it is for the reader, at least for me it was. It presents a good, strong female main character. Savannah knows what she wants, she wants more for her, her future and her family&#8217;s future, and she wants someone who loves her, no secrets, no hiding. Savannah is smart, strong and loving. She cares about her family and her friends. She has a good heart. She&#8217;s passionate about what she loves and I just liked her a lot. She&#8217;s such a relatable character. She seemed real. We also have a gorgeous male main character, Jack. He&#8217;s following his father&#8217;s step, even though it may interfere with what or who he wants for himself . He&#8217;s sweet and smart, but so scared of disappointing his dad. He&#8217;s learning, not just how to run a farm but to let himself care about someone and stand up for himself. I liked him a lot.This book, just like the previous books, shows a world where friends and family are important. Where what you want and need for yourself is as important as what others want for themselves and what they expect from you. It&#8217;s a beautiful series, because it encourages the readers to acknowledge how much self-worth matters. That we shouldn&#8217;t put everyone&#8217;s needs before ours. At least not always. While you&#8217;re reading, you get to see how the main character is growing as a person, challenging herself to do things that she never thought she would. And you kind of get to grow a little bit along with the characters.Oh! And I almost forgot... I especially LOVED Parker and Will's appearance. It was awesome and ohh I just loved it :).I love these books. I like how Miranda Kenneally presents a simple story but adds so many things to it, it ends up being a great and lovely book.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51kXmmxvtEL.jpg

The mystery was really good, I had so many theories of what was going on, but then something happened and I had to change my theory (again). So that was fun. There were so many possibilities and the author played them well.The characters were amazing, everyone played their part pretty well so that added a lot to the mystery. There was a good development of the characters. Tristan (I just loved him and felt so bad for him) was the sweetest, you could see how desperately in love he was with Ivy, and I liked her (sometimes, not always), you could feel her sadness and I think that was what made her take some crapy decisions (at least that's what I'm telling myself haha).

If you&#8217;re a fan of Jennifer Armentrout&#8217;s Lux series, you&#8217;ll enjoy this book.This is the story of Deliah and how her whole life was changed in a matter of months. Her grandmother recently died, her sister hates her and the nightmares that came around the same time of her grandmother&#8217;s death are giving her horrible headaches. Everything gets worse when the Wates come to town, Garreth, Leighton and Travis. Garreth being hot one second and cold the next, and Travis&#8230; he&#8217;s just down right mean. Leighton, on the other hand was sweet and friendly from the start. Oh, and let&#8217;s not forget about the horrible visions Deliah gets every time she crosses gazes with Garreth. Yes, these people are weird, they have deep secrets and all of them seem to lead to Deliah.This book was really, really good. I was hooked from the start. You won&#8217;t get to understand everything right away&#8230; But you start forming ideas of what&#8217;s happening and what are these secrets and monsters really about. I really liked the characters, they were all very, very well presented. Deliah is a shy girl, she doesn&#8217;t like attention, mainly because she&#8217;s gotten a lot of bad attention thanks to her scandalous sister. But she&#8217;s a strong character. She won&#8217;t stand anyone treating her badly or anything. Then we have Garreth&#8230; Oh I liked him! He first starts being this mean guy.. but as Deliah starts to get to know him&#8230; She starts seeing another side of him, a nicer side. A side she starts to like. He has some sweet gestures and he&#8217;ll do anything to protect those he loves. Leighton.. She&#8217;s a nice strong girl too. She&#8217;s the one who knows how to calm the people around her and get everything done right. Travis, well he&#8217;s full of surprises, I&#8217;ll tell you that.This is a really good story, and like my BBS said, it also reminded me of The Mortal Instruments series, but it was more like the Lux series to me. I loved Garreth and Deliah&#8217;s relationship. He&#8217;ll do anything to protect her and so will she. He&#8217;s sweet to her and you know he loves her. I really hope there&#8217;s going to be a second book. There&#8217;s no way this story is ending like this.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517RjPJQFrL.jpg

Everyone has problems, some people have it worst than others, but everyone should be able to find peace at some point and move on.I think this book presents two different but equally hard situations. First, you have Darby, who lost her sister when they were both just little kids. She grew up, sure, but didn't live. She had a routine and life, but she wasn't really living. Then you have Torin. He too lost someone really close to him, his brother, but under different circumstances, only he chose to give meaning to his life and his brother's death. I think it makes you think about how life in general, how we react to certain things and people. And to give ourselves (and other people too) second and third chances.The book was good, I liked it, I just didn't love it. The characters were ok, Darby was a bit too dependent for my taste. But I guess I understand why she was that way. She needed stability after losing a big part of her. I think I could relate a bit more with Torin though. I liked him better, he was so full of life, even after everything he'd been through. This book showed me something I think I already knew, but either way, we should always remember. Even after losing someone, people have to find a way to move on. It doesn't mean you have to forget, you just have to move on, live and enjoy life.I think that was what I liked the most, that and the cover, because seriously.. Look at that cover! I just loved it :)",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41LOcSEoAuL.jpg

She's Emi' and Jack's daughter. She's a teenager who's starting to see the world through her own eyes and wants to explore more, have more of it, and not by herself of course... There's Jon. Jon Augustus Scott. But there are rules. Contessa is a story of self discovery, growing up and love. But this is also a story that will show you the hard part of being a teenager and how rough relationships between parents and daughters (in this case) can be.My thoughts:First, let me tell you something.. It is no surprise that I loved this story. I mean, it's Lori L. Otto we are talking about. I can't not love her books. That being said, let me tell you what I thought about the story.I thought Contessa was a complicated book to read. Why? Simply because I'm not a teenager anymore and the attitude Olivia had towards some things was just so infuriating. But I guess that's just how kids are these days. I don't remember being that defiant. Just know that this book shows you exactly how kids act, well at least some. It is real. The thoughts, the attitude, the way Olivia saw everything... I thought it was pretty accurate to how a teenager would think and act. Lori's an expert writing real characters and real stories. It's amazing, how they always are just so right.I loved Contessa. This is a wonderful story that goes after the Emi Lost & Found series. Like I said before, this is about self discovery. Olivia is just starting to see the world through her own eyes, experiencing new things with not so new people, this includes Jack, Emi, Donna and Jon. She's exploring new things as an artist too and that's helping her understand her life a little better, to grow up as a person, it just took her a while to see the real meaning of her art.This book has so much love in it. It has a husband's love towards his wife; a wife's love towards her husband; their love towards their children. A boyfriend and a girlfriend's love towards each other. But mostly, a dad's love towards his daughter. And not only a dad's love... It's Jack's love towards Livvy. And that's beautiful, because every time Jack talked to Livvy, I could see and hear in my mind how much he loved her. It was like I was there, I saw Jack's expressions, heard his love for his daughter in every word he said... and I know this might sound insane, but I swear I felt it that way. It was impossible to read this and not feel how in love Jack was with his daughter (and I mean this in a fatherly way, not a creepy one!!!!), but you could see this from the moment he met her.While I was reading Contessa I was constantly frustrated, because Olivia's actions were too childish sometimes... But I also understood why she acted the way she did, after all, she was just a child. Until she realized that she had to take her responsibilities seriously... There's was never going to be any chance for her to be taken as an adult.The book is focus on one relationship in particular. You would think it was Jon's and Olivia's relationship, but to me, it was between Jack and Olivia. There was obviously a huge wall between them, one that Olivia had put there, one that Jack was constantly trying to take down. Their relationship was breaking and breaking with every passing day, because Olivia didn't want to see the beauty in it. So, it was heartbreaking for me to see how hurtful she was sometimes. Let me talk a little about the characters.Olivia.When I fist met her, she was the sweetest thing. Now, she's all grown up and wants to be on her own. Do what she wants, be with whoever she wants. Yes, she's kind of a brat, but she has the biggest heart. She's compassionate, she adores her family, even when she wasn't acting very maturely, I knew she loved them. I loved her relationship with Emi, it was beautiful to see how trusting they both were with each other. Emi was her mom, but she was also her friend. But Emi is like that.Olivia's art is something especial too. That bond she thought she had with Nate, at first I thought it was so amazing, that she could feel the way she did about someone she hadn't met. That she admired him so much. But then, it totally changed. I hated how she made Nate a bad influence, something that would eventually hurt her family so badly. That would hurt Jack and Emi so much.I love Nate, Lori knows this. He's my number one book boyfriend. And I felt so protective about him reading this book, because Livvy was damaging his image before everyone else's eyes (not mine of course). It wasn't fair. And just so we are clear... I know Nate wasn't perfect. I know this. But to me, he's one character that will stick forever with me. I don't agree with whoever thinks he couldn't have been a great father. He would have. He would've done ANYTHING for Emi and his family, if he'd had the chance. He would've made Emi happy. He would've have grown up, done things differently. I know it. Yes, she's one of the 3 characters with whom I've thought was possible to have two loves. BUT I do think Jack was, is and will always be the perfect father for Olivia.Jack has such an important role in this book and Olivia's life. He's always been so supportive of her and I hated she couldn't see that. She couldn't see past the fact that he was &#34;too protective&#34;. I guess, he kind of was, but I guess he has a lot of reasons to be. I loved Jack a lot more in this book. I saw some of his flaws, something that I didn't see in TSS or NLB. This book made him a lot more real to me. And I loved how he loved Olivia, even after everything she had said... But I guess that swap hat fathers do.Jon.Jon. Jon. Jon. Well, he is something. He's mature, he's passionate about the people and things he loves. He's ambitious, respectful, honorable. But he's also kind of bad. Not bad for Livvy, but like... He's defiant. He wanted to show her everything, and at first, I did think they were going too fast. Something that he'll realize later. I loved him. How sweet he was with Livvy. How he'd stand up to Jack and anyone for that matter, to defend Livvy. He loves her, that much is clear. And he knows what he wants and what he needs. When he thought they needed space, he said it. He was honest and I loved that about him.Oh and Donna? That lady is just too much. She's an amazing granna. I loved that she loved Olivia just as if she were her granddaughter for real. She's too loving, she cares a lot about people, especially those around her. I loved her from the very start.This book is just another reason of why I love Lori.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zAsLnVg1L.jpg

Otto. You just can't not love her books and her characters.First of all, I want to say thank you to Lori for giving me the chance to read and ARC of this amazing book. &#60;3 I loved it and I can't wait to read the next one.In book 1, you meet Contessa, Jack Holland's little girl, only she's not a little girl anymore. She's starting to grow up, to see the world through her own eyes and like I've said before, she wants it all, even if it means she has to lie and sneak around to get it. But this second book is another story.Olivia's life has had a lot of ups and downs since she was little, but still, she's managed to learn how to deal with those situations, sometimes making a lot of mistakes, but at the end she's done what she knows is right. There's more maturity in her and she tries to be as honest as she can, which is something I liked a lot. She's still the innocent little girl, but with more confidence.I don't know if I'm the only one who felt this way about the book, but I still don't feel like it was just a love story. Like in book 1, in which I felt it was the story of the struggle and reconciliation between a father and his daughter, to me, Olivia is the story of growing up. Of accepting accepting and being exactly who you are, no matter how the people around you see you or want you to be. She now has to deal with two great loss, two things she loved more than anything in her life. So she starts to focus all her attention in that other thing she loves, Jon. It was her way of dealing and what she thought would help her heal, because he kept her distracted and she needed that.Through the whole book I felt her struggle, how frustrated she was because she couldn't go back to the way she was before, some moments were more noticeable than others, and even though Jon made her completely happy, there was always something missing.Well, first I'd like to say that in this story you see the way the characters grow. I'm the youngest to the oldest, they've all learned different life lessons that made them a lot more patient a lovable and real. The story line is a lot more capturing, not that Contessa wasn't, but this one allows you to relate more and more to with the main characters.So, what did I think about Olivia this time? Well, she obviously grew up a lot since book 1. She's the same girl but with another perspective on life. She now knows, no doubt, how much her dad loves her, how much she means to him and her entire family. She's more confident about herself as a person and deep down, as an artist too. The only thing is, she became too dependent on Jon and their relationship, which kind of frustrated me. I feel she needs to be on her own a little, get to know herself a little bit better and experience life from her own perspective. And I think she'll get her time.I like Jon, I really do but, even though Livvy denied he was the reason and even though I KNOW Jon would never do that on purpose, I felt he was kind of holding her back. They both need time.I can't wait to read next book. I'm sure it will be as beautiful as all her books.&#60;3",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51REUH6NdwL.jpg

I&#8217;ve read A Discovery of Witches and Shadow of Night countless of times, I can quote it with my eyes closed, but really don&#8217;t take my word for it.

While some people think it&#8217;s tedious and rather boring, I have always found it fascinating and it intrigued me to no end with it&#8217;s rich world building. The Book of Life, like its predecessors, is a work of art, a true master piece. It&#8217;s no surprise that it&#8217;s profoundly and gallantly written. Harkness explores the usual concept and themes of her books. The plausible steamy romance, plenty of fun historical input, magic and paranormal.We also get to meet some of the old characters who are returning in the present times like Gallowglass and the other members of De Clermont family. That was such a fun part! I couldn&#8217;t help but crave more back story and while there are some twists that I didn&#8217;t anticipate coming, The Book of Life ended neatly.

It is my greatest weaknesses. de la Cruz and I have a pretty long history back then, Blue Bloods are one of the first vampire series that I&#8217;ve ever read and It follows up with Witches of East End which I wholeheartedly enjoy, book and tv-series wise!The Ring and The Crown have a large group of main characters. It follow the story of four girls and two princes. Marie-Victoria, the quiet gentle princess who is set to marry the crown prince of Prussia, Leopold. She has a best friend Aelwyn who is a sorceresses who one day will be the Queen&#8217;s Mage.

There are mouthful of titles and terms that thankfully isn't too confusing for my case.&#8226; Romance, the book have a lot of romance. Ronan and Wolf might be my favorite. There&#8217;s so many swoon alert there.&#8226; Four different female characters who have their own definition of the word &#8216;strong heroine&#8217;, yes as expected they have to worry about their fancy dresses, hair and their magic but they also have more pressing problems to face other than romance, that is simply awe-inspiring.WHAT I DIDN'T LIKED.&#8226; Plot Twists, by the last 30% of the book there are a lot of bombs dropping every now and then. That was overwhelming and too anticlimactic for me.&#8226; Emotional Development, I hope this department was polished and developed even more.&#8226; Some of the scenes of the book, I actually had seen it coming.Over all The Ring & The Crown is a fast paced book that will enticed you with it&#8217;s glamorous world.

You have no idea how I nearly cried when I got the approval to read the E-arc of The Unbound. I could have sworn the angels were weeping with me.The Unbound follows up where The Archived left off, as Mac starts her junior year at Hyde School. She&#8217;s struggling, trying to get her normal life back, but moving on isn&#8217;t easy when someone is haunting you, even in your waking hours. And then people are starting to vanish without a trace and the only thing they have in common is Mackenzie. She becomes the prime suspect, and unless Mac can track the real culprit, she&#8217;ll lose everything: her role as Keeper, her memories, and even her life.Immediately, I was thrust back into Mac&#8217;s world. The Unbound&#8217;s plot flows smoothly, I didn&#8217;t have any qualms getting into it. It was perfect. The world building is completely visually stunning. It&#8217;s as real as it gets, I felt like I was really walking in Narrows.I loved every single character in this book, though I&#8217;m not exactly fond of Agatha and Owen (that&#8217;s a complete different matter we shouldn&#8217;t event *shhhhush* speak about). I adored Mac, she&#8217;s one of my favorite protagonists and heroines. I can understand where she&#8217;s coming from, her story and pain are relatable. Half of the book was basically about how her walls are starting to crack and she doesn&#8217;t know how to pull herself back together, mentally and emotionally speaking. Wesley Ayers is one of the many reasons why I love this series, aside from the fact that he&#8217;s a drool-worthy kind of fictional character. He&#8217;s charming, smart and he genuinely care about Mac. Seriously, you will swoon. I certainly wouldn&#8217;t mind reading a book or e-novella in his point of view. Just Saying. All of the sideline characters are fully fleshed out just like the main characters. It&#8217;s nice to see new fresh faces. They heightened the book&#8217;s humor even more. The romance is well built. Mac and Wesley are as great together as they are individually. I can remarkably recall making this dying noise every time they have a scene together.And, of course, it isn&#8217;t Schwab&#8217;s book if it doesn&#8217;t make you feel like you&#8217;re already in heaven and the next thing you know, you&#8217;re lying on the cold hard ground, bleeding in pain. It&#8217;s okay, I forgive you, Victoria. I know you love to feed off your reader&#8217;s pain. It makes you healthy.I couldn&#8217;t express enough how brilliant The Unbound is. I didn&#8217;t put this book down till I was done. Victoria Schwab has that gift. She writes everything so beautifully. The Unbound surpassed every bit of my standards. A great follow up to an incredible series.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51FQWNmiYUL.jpg

She&#8217;s a new breed created by the epidemic Hothouse Flower.I&#8217;ve been waiting for this book since forever. I went in expecting something fluffy and a little bit of crying, but I was wrong. Hothouse Flower is told from alternating points of view of Ryke and Daisy. I shipped them from the very start. They both stole my heart in Ricochet.  They&#8217;re going to melt your heart, make it all gooey, and probably make you bawl in their own book.We all know why the equation R + D can&#8217;t ever happen. He&#8217;s twenty five. She&#8217;s finally eighteen. But that doesn&#8217;t sound as easy as it looks. Ryke knew Daisy when she was 15, 16, 17, and, aside from their &#8216;problematic&#8217; age gap, there are a lot of roadblocks and hindrances they need to overcome, like a disapproving mom, a not-so-pleased brother, the media, lots of family drama & their own inner demons.I&#8217;ve never been so in love with a book and characters before that I constantly feel like my heart is going to burst out of my chest. Yes! I&#8217;m talking about Hothouse Flower and the Addicted Series. Krista and Becca never fail to remind me why they&#8217;re one of my favorite pairs of authors and why I read books. It&#8217;s very difficult for me to articulate my feelings and put them into words. All I can say is that it hit me harder than I thought it would. Hothouse Flower is raw and painful. It left me with undeniable ache.Every single thing and element about this book is fully fleshed out and it&#8217;s something I highly praise. Like always, the characters are drawn brilliantly. They&#8217;re deep, complex and real. Probably one of the most beautiful sets of characters I&#8217;ve ever encountered. The romance is perfect. It&#8217;s everything I had hoped for and wanted. I could see it coming who would initiate the relationship. (Hah!) I&#8217;m sorry I just had to bring that up. It&#8217;s my badass I-told-you-so moment. Other than the 1, 2 ,3 ,4, 5, 6 common things that I&#8217;ve anticipated. The rest is holy cow unpredictable. A lot of times, I find myself wanting to bury myself alive because I cannot believe that just happened. Wait. What. What. It can&#8217;t. Exactly, that&#8217;s the picture.Aside from the romance, what I love the most in the book is the emotional impact of the media, family ordeal/drama and how their parents and upbringing affected them. For me the astonishing aspect of this novel is that our loved ones make mistakes, they make bad calls. No reasons can ever justify those. It will affect us, It will destroy us. But it&#8217;s our decision if we&#8217;re going to let it haunt us forever. Its deeply emotional read for me that has had me all choked up. It&#8217;s amazing because these things do happened in real life. We lived in this story. One way or another this book has something that will touch your heart.In each chapter, all of the emotions are heightened and are always tangible. Hothouse Flower is about guilt, pain, misery, grief, forgiveness, discovering yourself, the power of friendship, family, relationship and, most importantly, love.Reading Krista and Becca&#8217;s books once is simply not enough. You&#8217;ll go back to it every day and if not, every once in a while, just like home. After all of the heart-break I went through with Hothouse Flower, I couldn&#8217;t be anymore happy how it all turns out. This is easily one of the best and most heart wrenching book I&#8217;ve ever read to date.",5.0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hSyAO9EcL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"

Reading this amazing books was like stepping out of my comfort zone. It&#8217;s a completely alien thing for me. And it&#8217;s a great feeling. I can&#8217;t never get enough of it. I had never fathom that this could be my thing until it just suddenly happened. It knocked me off my feet. Hands down to this incredible series.Kiss the Sky is a stand-alone and spin-off book from Addicted Series and are told from Rose Calloway and Connor Cobalt point of view. Like Becca said in their blog post Kiss the Sky is a little bit different than Lily and Lo&#8217;s books and that&#8217;s not a bad thing. It&#8217;s like a breather from the pure rawness of its predecessors. I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s not going to be as painful as the others but kind of moderate but not really. In Addicted Series Connor is that guy who tutored Lily who happened to be Rose&#8217;s number one academic rival back then. We&#8217;ve watched their story unravel through the eyes of Lily and Lo but Kiss the Sky is the real deal. In this book we will see how will Rose and Connor will deal with their inner demons in their own Point of View.I always say this every time I read a alternate pov that are told from female and male point of view. I hate reading male point of view. Sometimes they sound obnoxious I couldn&#8217;t properly connect with the character but I guess it depends on the author. The writing is on point as always. I have no complains or what so ever. Hands down. Becca and Krista did a fantastic job. The plot flow smoothly. The spacing was just right. The Reality TV part was actually so fun to read. It was a rollercoaster ride of crazy, fun, steamy scenes and tension. Seriously just perfect.Connor and Rose are one of the most fascinating couple and characters I&#8217;ve ever come across. They&#8217;re the most self assured people in the world in the sense if you throw a bomb at their feet, they exactly know how they are going to fix it, Sherlock style. Kiss the Sky perfectly captured how will they both come undone as they handled all of the obstacles they have to face. I empathize and can relate to Rose so much (as the rest of the characters). She&#8217;s a very empowering woman. I was at the edge of my seat as I watched her struggled to not caved in at her desires. Her needs to be in control are one of the many things, I love about her! It&#8217;s a very rare thing to see in New Adult for a female character not to let a manhandle her. I adored that. I admit I underestimated Connor and never properly gave him enough credit. Kiss the Sky opened up my eyes. He&#8217;s a very complex character and I think this book perfectly showed his depth. He is amazing. I have a new found love and respect for Connor, It was very evident now. Connor and Rose character development and relationship progress was very apparent. The way that Connor put Rose welfare before his own and Rose clearing her schedule for Connor makes me want to cry. All of this little things showed how this characters changed so much. It was powerful, unlike any other romances. Swoon just swoon.You don&#8217;t know the exact definition of crazy and insane till you&#8217;ve read Kiss the Sky. I had never anticipated half of the things that Rose and Connor did in this book. They are everything I didn't expect them to be. Hey! genius can be crazy too. Their relationship cracks me up every time. I ship it! It was very comical in all honesty. The humor of Kiss The Sky is insanely funny. IT IS FLAWLESS. I need to paused every five seconds because of the ridiculous banter. I don&#8217;t know how Becca and Krista managed to do it after 3 books. I think they never ran out jokes that will make you cry for a minute or two.OH GOD OH GOD I CANT BREATHE. I COULDN&#8217;T PROPERLY ARTICULATE MY WORDS. I HAVE TOO MANY FEELINGS. Lily and Lo would always have a special place in my heart. They are such a cute little pie geeks. If you don&#8217;t ship them, you cannot sit with us. That's the rule here.Ryke and Daisy.Ryke Daisy are my babies. Their chemistry was like woah over the top. It&#8217;s all over the place. I was sold.I can say Ryke, Lo, Lily & Daisy are integral part of the series. One of the many greatest things about Kiss the Sky was Becca & Krista heightened the family bond and relationship of the characters. Like Rose main priority was wanting to take care of Lily and Daisy more than anything in the world, the cute affectionate animosity of Ryke and Connor, Lo and Rose. Connor, Loren & Ryke Bromance. Sisters love. I couldn&#8217;t emphasize enough how much I love it and I couldn&#8217;t have it on another way.Kiss the Sky reduced me to tears handful of times and it took me by surprised by its unexpected plot twists. It astound me how this series messed up with my emotions so many times. Basically this book solidify my growing love for this series. I can talk about this books and characters forever and I don&#8217;t think so anyone wanted that. Am I right? I&#8217;m a self proclaimed fan of Addicted Series and this amazing authors. Kiss the Sky surpassed ever bit of my expectation. I couldn't ask for anything better except more and probably more. It&#8217;s a book you wouldn't want to put down.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71LG78Mw6ZL.jpg

It follows the story of Tamar who has been in love with linebacker Abe since forever. She&#8217;d always considered them as soul-mates till she professed her feelings and Abe rejected her. It&#8217;s something she never forgot! Now years later Tamar landed a great opportunity to work for one of New York&#8217;s infamous athletic websites.

I love it more each time. What attracts me to this book is the concept of old childhood friends turned into lovers, which is the #1 fan service an author could ever do for me. There&#8217;s also a great deal of feminism points for Tamar. And like the previous installments, the New York Leopards cast made appearances. It was so fun reading and seeing them again.

I call myself a fair person, I don&#8217;t get annoyed easily and I have patience for cliche things and Dearest Clementine is not just decent, it&#8217;s outstanding.Dearest Clementine follow the story of Clementine Avery, who accidentally signs up for a romance writing class and is in dire need of sexy material for her assignment. Then she meets the RA, Gavin Murphy, who is more happy to help her find some inspiration.Clementine is a vibrant protagonist. She&#8217;s not difficult to love. It doesn&#8217;t hurt that she&#8217;s relatable, smart and feisty. She knows how to keep the reader engaged in the story! She also has the best comebacks.One of my favorite things about Dearest Clementine is Gavin and Clem&#8217;s funny banter. They are so sweet and did I already mentioned funny?&#8220;No, give me half an hour. I just ran and need to take a shower.&#8221; &#8220;See, that&#8217;s too much information. All your book boyfriend is going to do is fantasize about that for the next thirty minutes. That and those little black shorts.&#8221;Aside from that I also love and adore the protagonist relationship with her &#8220;girlfriends&#8221;.&#8220;Can I offer my unsolicited opinion?&#8221; I mumble into my pillow. &#8220;Will you stop talking if I say no?&#8221; &#8220;Probably not.&#8221;Dearest Clementine is not all fluffy and flirty, y e s, there&#8217;s a handful of steamy moments which is exactly just my taste. Lex Martin sure knows how to keep it going.As Gavin and Clementine grow closer they unravel some secrets about a missing student at Boston University and conflicts started to ensue in their relationship. While it doesn&#8217;t take a genius to discover the culprit, I immensely enjoyed the &#8220;mystery&#8221; element. Hands down to Lex Martin for using the &#8220;being stalked by professor&#8221; because this kind of story does really happen in real life and though some of the tropes in the story are the common twist in New Adult books nowadays, I still find it more neatly done.I already expressed how uncomfortable I am with the term of endearment used by Clementine and her friends. It&#8217;s one of my reading pet peeves. They say it in an affectionate and endearing way though and I understand that real life people also do this and that doesn&#8217;t stop me from enjoying a great book. Overall Dearest Clementine is a fantastic debut. It will certainly join my favorite &#8220;New Adult&#8221; shelf.",4.0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FpRZU-sRL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"

On this follow up story, Mae Koskinen and Justin Marc are both busy doing a classified investigation in and out of RUNA and to add more conflict to the story, some of the humans that are marked by divine also called elects are turning one another. On their next mission Lucian Darling and his delegation along with Justin and Mae are headed to Arcadia, their neighbor country. In this society women are treated as &#34;hot commodity&#34; and their religion have a massive impact and influence on their government.It is well established that I am a massive Richelle Mead fan. Almost everything she wrote, I completely devoured. Gameboard of the Gods is an outstanding book. I love every bits of it and that is so rich coming from someone who avoids the Sci-fi and Dsytopian section in bookstores. Immortal Crown is one of my highly anticipated books of 2014, with a heavy heart I'm going to tell you this book is disappointing. It sadly falls to the Sequel Syndrome. I would have never seen it coming from Richelle Mead since Frostbite, The Golden Lily are brilliant sequels that solidify my love for her series. Immortal Crown is more of an Succubus on Top hit or miss for me. It&#8217;s not engaging as it&#8217;s predecessor but the great thing about Georgina Kincaid is it got better after each book. I hope this will also be the case for Age of X series.Immortal Crown started out in a dull note, I reassured myself it would pick up eventually. But no no no. Mead's mojo didn't worked out this time. The terms was hard to grasp. I was tiptoeing for the half of the book, thankfully Mead's usual recapping helped me somehow in refreshing my mind on what happened in the first book & understanding some of the points I can't wrap my mind with.The misogynistic views of the Arcadian netizens, It was disgusting and twisted. It enrages me. It will definitely emit aggressive response from readers.The characters undergo on a little character development though I still believe their story arc should've gotten a pretty great thorough leap by now.The twist of the story are completely unnecessary. The pent up sexual tension between Mae and Justin went overboard in the last 30% of the book.Immortal Crown isn't the book I was hoping but I did really like it. It's not a terrible book in a long shot but I wish there are many things that could've furnish. Hopefully this will be a series that continue to get better in each installment.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/91AJGLTyE2L.jpg

It&#8217;s so pretty, beautiful and eye catching to be exact but like most books, a shinny cover doesn&#8217;t always mean the book itself will be dazzling but This Is Now did not disappoint!This is Now follows the story of Jess who aspires to study at university despite her dysfunctional family belief that she shouldn&#8217;t expect more because of her social status. Then she meets Sebastien, a gifted cellist, who is completely from a different clique. He&#8217;s perfect and talented and has great faith in Jess despite all of the frightening secrets she&#8217;s keeping.

I connected with Jess, the protagonist, immediately. I like the way she narrates and perceives things. WARNING: There were some instances where I wanted to shake her because I really think she can make better life choices. Despite my love/hate tension with her, she improves nonetheless. I liked her though initially I was overwhelmed by how much she worshiped gushed about Sebastien&#8217;s godly structural face. If I were in her shoes I probably would have also but seriously I don&#8217;t want the whole novel to be all about Sebastien&#8217;s face because we got that covered in the first 30% of the book. Thank God those fleeting moments passed. Sebastien is a great male pair for Jess. They are so different yet they fit together perfectly. Seriously guys, swoon. YOU WILL SWOON. The secondary characters are fully fleshed out as much as the main characters. I wouldn&#8217;t mind reading books about them also.I liked the plot of the book. It&#8217;s not an unusual one but it was well written. The plot flow smoothly and is pretty much a coming-of-age based concept. I appreciated how the book served a great moral lesson in that no matter where you came from, you can still make a different life for yourself. Maggie Gilbert wrote the romance beautifully. It was believable although the ending is quite cheesy. They are so cute and their relationship is one of the many things I adored about the book!

I&#8217;ve read The Boleyn Reckoning last March and I can still perfectly remember every single thing that I felt while reading this book. It certainly involved ugly sobbing and thrashing till 3AM. I think I will always have this heavy feeling on my stomach and chest that will never go away every time I think of this book. It&#8217;s sorrow having to say goodbye to one of my favorite trilogies and to these dear characters. I couldn&#8217;t get enough of that to the point I&#8217;ve read it more than 2 times. I am morbid, I need to remind myself every once in a while that masterpieces like this exist.There are plenty of reasons why The Boleyn Trilogy is one of my favorite book series ever and why YOU SHOULD READ IT. I am not lying through my teeth when I tell you this is absolutely the most brilliant Historical Fiction &#8211; Alternate History books out there.The Boleyn Reckoning quickly follows up where the previous book left off: Minuette and Dominic have to face the consequences of their secret marriage. As England prepares themselves for the threat of invasion, William finally discovers the truth. It&#8217;s an act of betrayal that will put Dominic and Minuette&#8217;s lives in danger. William&#8217;s need for vengeance might push England to the brink of civil war like it was always written in the stars. Elizabeth must choose her brother, or her country?Sometimes when you read an Alternate History book, it just doesn&#8217;t fit with your taste and expectation. It flops. The great thing about Laura Andersen is she has this wonderful gift: she perfectly throws the readers into History that somewhat already happened and she&#8217;ll wiggle her fingers TA-DA! creating an even more perfect fiction than reality. Her books are always written so vividly and with supplemental details that really brought the whole plot to life. The Boleyn Reckoning is well paced, all of the characters are interesting and well developed.In fear of spoiling the book to everyone, I&#8217;ll keep this review neat and short.As much as I hate to say goodbye to this trilogy, The Boleyn Reckoning is engrossing, unflinchingly brutal. It will take you at the edge of your seat. It ended neatly and bittersweet.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51NF9%2BUuD8L.jpg

The first forty pages were rough for me but once I get through those I was sold and I just fell in love with Miller&#8217;s intelligent novel.&#8220;What if there was an app that told you what song to listen to, what coffee to order, who to date, even what to do with your life&#8212;an app that could ensure your complete and utter happiness? What if you never had to fail or make a wrong choice?What if you never had to fall?&#8221;Free to Fall follows the story of Rory Vaughn who is pretty much content living her life following what her Lux app recommends. When she&#8217;s accepted to the prestigious boarding school Theden Academy, her future seems to be even more certain. However, once she settles into her dream school she unravels some secrets that will lead her to question Lux&#8217;s credibility and everything might not be as it seems.Free to Fall has a very interesting premise that hasn&#8217;t been done before. It&#8217;s refreshing and realistic. We are so dependent on Wi-Fi, internet, phone, laptop and other gadgets. I can see this book happening in real life, years from now. One of the great things I adore about the book is you can easily get lost with the story despite the fact it&#8217;s set in the future.The main message of the book itself is terrifying as it seems youalways have a choice. That&#8217;s so simple yet beautiful and powerful. Free to Fall is a great portrayal of fierce protagonist and women, fantastic lady friendship, swoon-worthy guy, and cute romance. Free to Fall is a combination of serious business technology talks with a fluffy and swoon worthy romance scenes. Don&#8217;t worry as it doesn&#8217;t take over the plot. It&#8217;s just right.Free to Fall is very well written. Miller delivers a perfect intricate plot that will make your head spin with it&#8217;s interesting convoluted technology talk. Everything is just grand and has a purpose. While some scenes are predictable, I believe there are still twists that you won&#8217;t see coming.Free to Fall is a brilliant sci-fi read.

The Darkling is ruling Ravka while Alina and her people who worship her as a saint, sun summoner are hiding underground with the help of the oddly suspicious Apparat but her mind is set somewhere else like finding out if Nikolai Lantsov is still alive and hunting the last Morozova's amplifier, the firebird.This conclusion of The Grisha Trilogy received such a heated response. You either love or hate it. There's no middle ground.Ruin and Rising is not in the same caliber as Shadow and Bone & Siege and Storm. It's nowhere near fluff. It is brutal and unflinchingly cruel. It didn't evoked warm, fuzzy and giggly feelings from me, Sure I felt that in some particular scenes but not as strongly as its predecessors.Like expected from Bardugo, her writing is bloody stellar. Readers will easily get back to the story with Ravka's lush setting and the character's wit. There's the usual humor of Bardugo's story every now and then. Those scenes will never get old. One way or another everyone can easily identify with this bunch of flawed characters.Honestly this is how I always imagined the ending would be. I leaned for that because I knew it's going to happen. I'm not pleasantly surprised anymore but my heart doesn't want to say goodbye yet. There will always be this heavy feeling.Some people might disagree but The Grisha Trilogy's ending is groundbreaking. It's message is simply beautiful. (view spoiler) It's about a girl who gave up a crown, an enormous power, her childhood, home and her everything to saved her nation, that pain and sorrow isn't the end. Time doesn't heal anything maybe it just lessen the pain and what truly remain is love and that you'll always find your way back home. Being ordinary and leading an ordinary life with the people you love is sometimes the most extraordinary thing in the world.This kind of story will stay within me forever. Ruin and Rising will certainly leave it's readers breathless, heartbroken somewhere satisfied and yet always begging for more.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517mu4vaPrL.jpg

Seraphina are probably one of the most hype book ever, It&#8217;s on my bucket list since forever and when I finally grabbed the chance to read it I&#8217;m nothing but nerves. I was so excited to dived into this world and see if the fuzz are all worth it.Seraphina started out as slow, It was perfectly fine with me thinking it would actually got better as the story unravels. There&#8217;s occasional hilarious and witty moments that make up for the rather bland part. As I read further I found something that doesn&#8217;t sit well with me and I guess you could say it bothers me up for quite a bit. I&#8217;ve read handful of fantasy books set in medieval periods and I didn&#8217;t had any rough time connecting with the story and especially with the dialogue. I don&#8217;t know if it was only me but the dialogue, pleasantries and some of the terms the author used was really confusing and hard to grasp. The characters were all fine but poorly developed for example [Spoiler Alert] Seraphina had talked to Lucian for several times then they had a quarrel about fraternizing with dragons and the next thing I know Seraphina was crying in a bathroom stall because she realized she loved Lucian. I don&#8217;t know about you but that doesn&#8217;t really make me giddy. It came out of nowhere. It was poorly developed. Seraphina is a nice heroine. I don&#8217;t have any problems with her except I didn&#8217;t fell madly in love with her. I&#8217;m weird like that.I never thought I would ever say this but Seraphina is a disappointing read. I expected much better from this book.",2.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61kZ5cqRedL.jpg

It was intriguing and a good read though I wasn&#8217;t impressed as I thought I would be. I was expecting to have an emotional breakdown afterwards, to connect more with the plot and characters but like with Rainbow Powell&#8217;s Eleanor & Park, this book is a hit and miss for me.While I struggled with my initial perception of this book. I genuinely appreciate and like the music and playlist references. The author hit a lot of great marks about &#8220;accepting who you are&#8221; and great quotes.

Young Adult),"Eleanor and Park are one of 2013 widely popular book. It was impossible for me to ignored it. I honestly couldn&#8217;t make out how to rate it yet. I liked it just fine. I didn&#8217;t form a bond with it unlike some books with the same theme like Heart on a Chain (though this book is totally different in so many ways because the author managed to elaborate the protagonist family history such as abused, emotional blackmail and what stemmed that action etcetera some things this book failed to explained but that&#8217;s a tale for another day.) I originally gave it four stars but as I more pondered about it,I enjoyed Eleanor and Park just fine but not enough to give it four stars.This book is told from Eleanor and Park point of view. According to the book synopsis they are two star-crossed misfits which can be misleading for Park&#8217;s part because yeah he encountered brief confusion throughout the novel whether he&#8217;s Chinese or that stupid asian kid but he fit in just fine. He&#8217;s hardly an outcast unlike Eleanor who is the school pariah because she&#8217;s weird and she&#8217;s odd for everybody&#8217;s standard. The narration is told from Eleanor & Park point of view. It&#8217;s back and forth, thankfully it&#8217;s not as confusing as it looks though it bothered me that some of the chapters were too short for my taste. It come off as sloppy attempt at writing dual point of view. I didn&#8217;t know they still do that anymore till now.&#34;Was it possible to rape somebody's hand?&#34;When I've read this part, I gasped out loud. I did tried my best to understand it was told from Park&#8217;s perspective who&#8217;s a 16 years old boy but you should&#8217;ve known better than to lightly used that word, it&#8217;s not a good enough reason. This matter should be addressed properly because I saw a lot of people quoting this statement and romanticizing it. It doesn't sit down well with me. Rape is not an adjective word you should use lightly, just because you feel liked it. I&#8217;m sure the author meant well and she probably doesn't realized how problematic the connotation of that quote. I just hope she could&#8217;ve used a far better word that could perfectly described how Park felt that time though there are no more retracting, what is done is done. End of Rant.God forgive me but I gauged my eyes out and barfed when Park&#8217;s dad let his sixteen years old kid who just got his license recently, drive her girlfriend to Minnesota, he even gave his son a money! Why didn&#8217;t Park&#8217;s dad thought of driving the teenagers to their destination? WHYYYYYYYY. WHYYYYYYYY. WHYYYYYYYY. Fun Fact: I&#8217;m nineteen years old and my parents still doesn&#8217;t trust me to drive a car by myself. Mainly because the road is a very dangerous place to be. I can&#8217;t even fathom the road and drivers back in 1986. It is very unrealistic scenario for me.I enjoyed the romance though sometimes it can be cheesy. Eleanor and Park ended in an abrupt manner in the way I was really unsatisfied how this book ended. There&#8217;s no formal closure. Eleanor and Park is a book of contradiction for me. Clearly It&#8217;s not a horrible book since it received countless of rave reviews. There was so much buzz and hype about Eleanor and Park, I had such a high expectation about this book. I was anticipating crying my hearts out afterwards, suffering a post depression but It didn't left me with anything except to feel like there&#8217;s something missing.",2.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71LkLmxqgjL.jpg

I want to give 5 stars because this book screwed me emotionally. And I CAN'T quit thinking about this crazy book!Nina- I felt bad for you, I truly did. At some point I lost my compassion for you.

I was reading with my mouth hanging wide open. This is a captive story, take my warning. If this type of book isn't normally what you read, then stay away! This is by far one of the darkest of the darkest. Lana goes through a tragic event, it's not sugar coated. The captor isn't your average hero that falls in love with his victim and they live happy ever after. This is the real deal!!! This was in third person, normally it's hard for me to connect with characters, not the case here. I felt like Lana's actions/thoughts would be exactly what I would've done.The Second Part wasn't as dark. Quite interesting to say the least. Intriguing, thought provoking and strange at times. I can't say too much without giving the story away. But, what do you do when you think you've turned into the monster? Lana is awakened to a world she knows nothing about, but she needs it, was it always there? Or is she just as depraved as her captor?

It took me a bit to grasp the whole concept, words from a wise one: read the glossary! I absolutely LOVED the connection between Zoe and the whales, it was beautiful, refreshing, and heartfelt!

This is the second book of The VIP Trilogy. I would recommend reading VIP first.I really hate Lilith, but love her just as much. How can something so bad, feel so right? This was a damn rollercoaster ride.We really do get The Madam's whole story. Lilith's mother was Madam, VIP has been in the hands of powerful women from the start, generations ago, passed from mother to daughter. I was mortified by Lilith's mother, she ruled Lilith with fear and power. Her mother bred her for one purpose, to take the throne as Madam. I'm not sure she ever loved her, to be honest.&#34;Tell me, Madam, if I cut you, will you even bleed?&#34;VIP is all Lilith has ever known, and when she gets a taste of the power, the control, she's immediately hooked.&#34;You see that women on display; you see her eyes, her face, her skin; she's beautiful. She's whatever she wants to be. She owns everything and anything around her. She's a vision. She's wanted and needed. She runs the show. She is in control of it all. She will be Madam one day... She is you.&#34;Lilith makes no apologies, she tasted the power, and she plotted to have all the control. And she does. Not when her mother gave it to her... NO SHE TOOK IT!Love is weakness, show no weakness. Don't expect an HEA in this story. It's not going to happen. As much as I hate Lilith, (Madam) I equally loved her, I wanted something good in her life, especially love.&#34;I had the world at my disposal. Absolutely anything I ever wanted I could have. Except love...&#34;There is some shocking twists and turns... Events, actions come full circle. My mouth was hanging wide open. The ending left my heart beating out of my chest. I can't wait to read the conclusion to this trilogy.I have to leave this review with one of my favorite quotes from this book.&#34;I want to f--- you in order to teach you. I want to f--- you to taste you. More than anything, I want to f--- you...to make you. I want to make you a VIP.&#34;FOR THE LOVE, M. Robinson!

The story starts out with life long friends becoming lovers. I predicted that part. There's Amy and Ryan, the perfect couple. I thought it was weird we were also getting Brandon's point of view. I'm reading along, wait, what, why am I in Brandon's head. Brandon is Ryan's best friend, well he's also close to Amy. A triad of friendship. Don't go thinking this a love triangle, well, not really. ANYWAY, there's a reason we are in Brandon's head. I actually liked Brandon's POV, he was the edgier bad boy type that we all love!!!SO, 65% in and I'm picking my jaw up off the floor!!!! OMFG Did this really happen, am I reading this right? I DID NOT SEE THIS COMING! NO EFFING WAY!I feel like the huge twist in the story will shock most and piss off more but I think it defines what the story is really about. &#34;Saving Amy&#34; I got teary eyes at the end, it was bittersweet!

I'm sucked in, addicted, I'm up at 1am writing this review, because I couldn't sleep until I got everything off my chest.&#34;My world will never be the same. This girl blew in like the spring wind and whipped me around like a hurricane.  She took over my life, she got Spencer to commit to her, and she made Ford feel things.&#34;Spencer and Ford's banter had me rolling.&#34;Don't get excited, Rook. It's not something cool like a motorcycle. I mean, he gave you opera tickets last night for &#34;effs&#34; sake.&#34;The relationship between Rook and Ronin made me swoon.&#34;Ronin Flynn, you are my forever guy.

Why?I would've been fine not knowing Ford's true feeling. I could've went through life clueless.

I make it worse.So she's left with no more doubts about what kind of man I am. So she will release her hold on me. So she will stop looking at me like she cares.So I can let go and move on.I turn away.I walk out.And I never look back.&#34;This would be why I was torn.Sorry for yelling through this review!!!!!I LOVE THIS SERIES!THANK HELL I GET FORD NEXT!And this is going on my favorites shelf for good reason.

I loved her tenacity, her fire, her ability to beat the man that created the game. It was fascinating getting in the mind of Victor, he's definitely a tortured soul.&#34;She stole from me. She lied to me. She exposed me. She destroyed me utterly. She played my game and won, and in the process she renewed my faith in that unspeakable thing.

In a good and bad way. I have mixed feelings about the characters. Let's just say this was EROTICA at it's Hottest! HOLY MOLY it was hot!Julian has lived a sheltered life, a daughter to a overprotective father/pastor. The story starts with Julian finding her independence. She meets up with twin brothers Tristan and Rance at a bar, going against everything her father has tried to keep her from. I DID NOT EXPECT WHAT CAME NEXT! Say what? The brothers like to share... They instantly felt the need to protect Julian.My problems- 1)  I never felt like Julian was in any danger. More of a backstory, more character development would've helped paint a better picture for me. It was sweet the way the boys took care of her, but I found myself frustrated with their overprotective side. Did see leave one prison for another?2) Repetitive. The whole book was sex, (which was at hot, but I need substance too) Julian apologizing constantly to the boys and how much she owed them. Twice was enough.I thought after reading the blurb this would have more suspense. I was thinking her father was abusive. Not really the case here, I mean too overbearing, overprotective, but not abusive.This could've been so much more, I thought the story had an interesting plot, but it was lacking in character development and emotion!",3.0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-ShfgGkwL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"

SPOILER: yes, she figured out how ridiculous she was acting after awhile, but it was too unbelievable and too annoying that she would act that way even for awhile.Also, the hero jumped to conclusions big time and was extremely obnoxious to the heroine.  I don't care how sexy someone looks, if they act that way, 99% of the women would not be attracted to him.  Behavior is involved in sex appeal, not just appearance.Thirdly, the heroine said very inflammatory things to people.  Again, as you mature a little, you know that that behavior is more likely to get someone trying to get even with you and escalate the situation.

She is hiding a horribly tragic past as she makes a new home for herself in Redbud, Ky. She has friends here and has even fallen in love with a man who wants to marry her. Her deepest desire is to settle down and have a loving family of her own. The dream appears to be coming true for Delanie, but it all begins to unravel one night when she discovers the body of her friend, Clara. Clara has been murdered and Delanie is forced into the public eye. This is a place she does not want to be. She has too much to hide and too much to lose if her true identity is discovered.The book flashes back and forth from present day to Delanie's teen years, when she was not Delanie at all. She is really Laura Denton, a young girl accused of a crime of the worst kind. She swore she was innocent. No one believed her. She was a victim of a rush to judgement and an arrogant police chief. Even her own father turned against her. Now, as a grown woman, Delanie once again finds herself in a position which casts doubt on her credibility. Will she be able to find justice for Clara? Will she be able to maintain her present life while doing what she believes is right? She has been living a lie and her past has finally caught up with her, just as she is finally feeling at peace with herself. Has God abandoned her as everyone else has? Will faith sustain her? The turn of events following Clara's murder are full of suspense, fear, and injustice. Delanie is forced to come face to face with the horror of her past. Will it destroy her future?

This is an era of history of which I know little about. I learned much while reading this fascinating book. I also found the main characters to be strong and quite endearing.There were many religious differences in the early 1700's. In this story, Genevieve Gaillain and her sister, Aimee, arrive in America on a ship named the Pelican. They journey to the Louisiana Territory in search of husbands, but primarily to flee religious persecution. They expect much more than they find in the New World. Life is difficult, disease is common, and the region is tense with political problems.Tristan Lanier is the first man Genevieve meets as she leaves the Pelican. He helps her ashore and their paths continue to cross. Both Genevieve and Tristan harbor past secrets. Tristan has lost his faith in God, and Genevieve is true to her faith no matter how much, or how often, that faith is tested. They seem to be at odds, yet feel an undeniable attraction to each other. Many hardships and much intrigue forge their relationship. Tristan and Genevieve continue to grow individually, and as a couple, throughout the book.As I said, I was unfamiliar with this period of history when I began reading. By the end of the book I had learned so many things about early Gulf Coast history! I was drawn into the story and really enjoyed discovering how the plot unfolded. Beth White is a gifted writer who is able to transport the reader to another time and place in a way which educates and entertains. The Pelican Bride is rich in historic detail, romantically touching, and thought provoking in spiritual matters.

They are so entertaining that I can't pick a favorite...I love them all!Felicia Murdock is the main character in this book. She has spent years trying to win the affections of Reverend Michael Fraser, at the expense of being herself and following the path intended for her. On the day Fraser marries another, Felicia faces the reality that she was not meant to be the wife of a minister. She is alone in her room, grieving her loss, when Grayson Sumner arrives at her home. He is a British Lord, and the brother of Felicia's friend, Eliza.Grayson has been sent to cheer up Felicia, but he finds the task to be quite daunting. She is a high spirited and frustrating woman who leads him into much trouble. Felicia is about to find out that Sumner comes with his own kind of trouble. Together, they get into one complicated situation after another. There is much action in this book and it is filled with adventure, intrigue, and danger.Sumner has quite a sordid past and it is finally catching up with him. He left his family behind in England and spent many years in China. Now he is ready to settle down and lead a peaceful life in the United States. However, that is not to be the case for him at the moment. Felicia and her friends had no idea that Grayson has been involved in the Chinese underworld, but they are about to be dragged into much trouble because of Grayson's past.Through it all, Felicia is drawn to Grayson Sumner. He is a man who understands her and is not put off by her rather outlandish personality. Grayson is also feeling deep affection for Felicia, but he does not allow himself to show his emotions, as he feels he is not worthy of love...not Felicia's, and surely not God's.All of the characters from the previous books in this series are involved in the lives of Felicia and Grayson. The entire group is in danger because of Grayson's past. This book is so well written that I had no idea how it would end. I could hardly wait to find out what would happen next. I will say that the ending took me by surprise.If you like romance, a message of redemption, adventure, humor and mystery, then you will love this book as much as I did!

My favorite by Tamera Alexander. I love horses and also Southern history, so this book pulled me in and held my attention to the very last page! It is simply beautiful in every way!The main characters, Olivia Aberdeen and Ridley Cooper, are both outcasts in Southern society in the aftermath of the Civil War. Olivia is the widow of a man who was murdered because he was a traitor to the Confederacy. She carries the shame of that marriage, which causes her to be determined never to love or trust a man again. Ridley is also a traitor to the South. He left his home in South Carolina, fought for the Union while his brothers remained loyal to the Confederate army. They arrive at Belle Meade Plantation on the same day. Olivia because she was invited to live at Belle Meade by her mother's best friend, and Ridley because he is seeking a job working with the thoroughbred horses which are raised on the estate.Belle Meade is owned by former Confederate General William Giles Harding. He has no idea that Ridley fought for the North, and assumes he fought with the Confederate forces. Ridley forms a bond with former slave (and resident horse whisperer), Bob Green and rises to the position of foreman. General Harding is impressed with Ridley and trusts him to manage the stud farm.At General Harding's request, Olivia is put in a position to work closely with Ridley. She is shocked to find that she is developing deep feelings for the man. Ridley is also falling in love with Olivia, even though he has no intention of remaining at Belle Meade for very long. All the while, General Harding is playing matchmaker and would like to see Olivia married to one of his associates. Olivia and Ridley deal with many personal issues which keep them from admitting their love for one another. The story is captivating and very well written.The Harding family and their servants actually did reside at Belle Meade Plantation. Many of the characters really did exist. This adds to the interest of the book. You can visit Tamera Alexander's blog and find photos of the Hardings and their estate. Ms. Alexander took painstaking care in her historical research. As a reader, you feel like you are living in the post-Civil War South as you read this novel. It is deeply moving, historically enlightening, and I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this period of history. Such a tragic and sad time.

It is one of those wonderful novels which one can't put down!The main character, Miss Arabella Adams, is a women's suffrage activist intent on helping women better their circumstances. Her good intentions get her into quite a bit of trouble.Private Investigator, Theodore Wilder, is sent in search of Arabella when her family can't locate her. Theodore finds her in jail as a result of Arabella trying to help a naive young woman who thought she was going to marry a man she never met. That situation is the basis for the plot of the story and leads to much more trouble for Arabella and Theodore.Independent and unwilling to admit she needs help, Arabella is immediately at odds with Theodore Wilder. He is chauvenistic and believes a woman's place is in the home, catering to her husband.Thus, &#34;A Most Peculiar Circumstance&#34; takes off and leads the reader down a high-spirited path of adventure, suspense and romance. Along the way, you will meet many interesting characters, most of whom try their matchmaking skills with Arabella and Theodore. A most unlikely match, indeed!While enjoying this book, I found myself laughing out loud, cheering for BOTH Arabella and Theodore, and learning much about the women of the 19th Century. This novel also carries a serious message about our judgment of others. Arabella and Theodore have strong opinions, but through their involvement with one another, they learn to accept differences in others. This leads them to realize they can overcome their own stubborn, independent streaks and find themselves accepting each other, too.It truly is a &#34;Most Peculiar Circumstance&#34; when they find themselves falling in love!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51CGh6sboeL.jpg

In this book the reader will find romance, suspense, spine tingling fear, and a deep theme of good vs evil. I read it in one day because I simply could not put it down! This book is also a bit different than a typical Christian Historical. Set in 19th Century England, it is more of a Gothic novel. It reminds me of the works of the Bronte sisters. There is murder, blackmail, abuse, and even atheistic situations throughout the book. Yet it is a book which causes the reader to really think about faith...losing it and gaining it. It will appeal to all readers.While the plot is complicated and quite intricate, the reader will be pulled into the story immediately. I was! I must also add that this is the first book in a trilogy, and is not a stand-alone novel, but after you read this one, you will want to read the next two in order to discover what happens. There are loose ends at the end of the story, but it only adds to the anticipation of the next release.The main character is Julia Elliston, a young woman who finds herself in a troubling personal situation after the death of her mother. Much about her past has been hidden from her. She has a Guardian, but it does not appear that he is a beneficial element in her life. She does not even know who he is, except that he is controlling and demands that Julia obey him. She is desperate to escape and hopes to marry a childhood friend, Edward Auburn. When she visits an old friend of her late mother's, Julia makes the tragic discovery that Edward is no longer a viable option for her. The two still love one another, but their circumstances in life have caused their ties to be severed. Julia feels betrayed by Edward and believes her dream of a future with him is shattered. The suspense and intrigue begins when a titled dowager takes Julie under her wing and prepares her to meet gentlemen who might marry her. Julie is desperate to be wed in order to escape her Guardian.The man who truly wishes to win Julia's heart is Mr. Chase Macy, a recluse twice Julia's age who has a dark past and hides even darker secrets. However, Mr. Macy does woo Julia and he becomes her protector. I have to admit that I felt the same doubts about Mr. Macy as Julia does while I read the book. Something about him just isn't quite trustworthy, yet he is a character who really does seem to have a sincere affection for Julia. I also found myself favoring Mr. Macy over Edward at times. An author who causes the reader to feel the same emotions as the main character in the book is truly a writer with talent...and Jessica Dotta is a tremendously talented writer!The plot thickens when Mr. Macy reveals that he knows Julia's Guardian and tells her he is a man to be feared. As this unknown man appears on the scene, along with Edward, Julia is forced to make dangerous decisions. I won't reveal more about the plot, as it will give away too much of the tale. I will say that, even after finishing the book, I do not know what will happen to Julia, Edward, or Mr. Macy. Many unexpected events await in the pages of Born of Persuasion. The reader is left wanting more...and there will be more in the second book of the trilogy. I'm currently waiting to read and review book two...&#34;Mark of Distinction&#34; and I can hardly stand waiting to receive it! Julia's story is one which will remain with me for a long time. It is a thriller!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51VuBZ7kh2L.jpg

Now, I want to read the first two books!As soon as I started reading this novel, I was pulled in. The plot takes some unexpected turns, the characters are interesting and each is struggling with their own personal issues. Through all of this, there are murders being committed in the quiet town of Kingdom, Kansas. The bodies of women are being found, each body is disposed of in the same manner, so the killings must all be related. Who could be so evil in such a peaceful town? Is the killer an outsider, or might it actually be a member of their own community? Imaginations run wild and accusations fly!The main characters, Callie and Levi, uncover many unsettling facts about the murders, and about themselves and their relationship. Their love is tested many times, as is their faith. Many times while reading Unforeseeable, I really could not guess what was going to happen next. Not only is the story suspenseful, it is also quite inspirational.This book was so unpredictable and uniquely written, that I truly had no idea who committed the murders until the final chapters unfolded. I could not put it down until I discovered just exactly what was going on in Kingdom.I highly recommend this book. No matter which genre is your favorite, you will not be disappointed in this novel.

Raina's Choice is book 3 in the Western Justice series. It's a stand-alone novel and you do not need to read the first two books in order to understand the third. The main characters in the book are Raina Vernay and Tyler Kincaid.Raina has inherited half of the Silver Dollar Saloon from her mother. Her sister owns the other half, but is married to a man who cares nothing for her and is constantly making advances toward Raina. Raina wants nothing more than to run away and start a new life. The opportunity presents itself when Ty comes to town. He is a stranger, but is also running away from his past. Raina breaks Ty out of prison, sells her half of the saloon, and heads to Fort Smith with Ty. She is in search of the father she has never known and believes him to be somewhere in Indian territory, based on a single letter she has which her father wrote to her mother many years ago. When she arrives in Fort Smith, she shows some people an old photograph of her father, hoping they may have some idea where she might find him. Ty takes her on a journey to track down one of the leads about her father.Raina meets a man named George who begins to care for her and wishes to marry her. This disturbs Raina. It also disturbs Ty. Could it be because they have fallen in love with each other? While questioning herself and God about what to do about George, Raina gets word that Ty is dead. She is deeply saddened by the news and realizes at that point that she cares deeply for Ty. Is it too late? Will Raina be given a second chance at true love?Raina's Choice is a good book, though not the best I've read by Gilbert Morris. It held my interest and was an easy read. If you enjoy reading about the Old West, you will like this novel. Gilbert Morris was a Pastor for ten years and then became an English professor at a Baptist college. His novels are always well researched and full of historical detail. They always carry a strong message of faith, too. I recommend Raina's Choice as a very decent Christian Historical Fiction novel.I received a copy of this book from the publisher, through The Book Club Network (bookfun.org) in exchange for my honest review.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51wknS3NjWL.jpg

Before I say anything else, you need to know that these are not stand alone novels. You must read book one (Born of Persuasion) in order to follow the plot continued in book two. Believe me, you will want to read both, as this is a thrilling series!Mark of Distinction continues the story of Julia Elliston, a woman who becomes known as the Emerald Heiress. She is a woman who seems to have no control over her own life, being manipulated at every turn by many who do not have her best interest in mind.The story itself is narrated by Julia as she nears the end of her life and looks back to her youth. She wants her story to be told...and what a story!There is mystery, intrigue, and suspense throughout. Many of the characters in the first book return, in addition to new characters, most of whom can't be trusted. Some are just plain evil!Lord Pierson is protecting Julia from the evil Mr. Macy...or is he? He has plans of his own for Julia and those plans are to use her to his own advantage. He is a cold, calculating man.Julia is still in love with Edward Auburn, a man of faith who is one of the only truly good influences in Julia's life. She will never forget him, but is kept from him as she becomes more deeply entangled in the schemes of others around her. Another character, Lord Dalry, seems to treat Julia with kindness, but nothing is as it seems in this book!This novel is so good I could not stop reading! Each page drew me deeper into Julia's life. Jessica Dotta has such talent, and tells a tale much like classics by the Bronte sisters. I highly recommend Mark of Distinction.The final book in this trilogy is scheduled for release next year. I truly do not know how I can wait that long to find out what happens to Julia! Based on my enjoyment of the series thus far, I know it will be worth waiting for!I received a copy of this book from the publisher, courtesy of The Book Club Network (bookfun.org) in exchange for my honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5117trr2fCL.jpg

Like many of us, Kelley Latta grew up in the Christian faith, but it took years for her to find a deeper meaning to her life.I found this Bible study to be insightful, deeply moving, and helpful in developing a stronger faith and relationship with Christ. Kelley interjects her personal experiences with scripture which pertains to her commentary. The book is divided into 5 days of study for 4 weeks. Each day finds the reader studying scriptures and then answering questions about the verses. Those questions are thought provoking and help the reader to better understand what it is to give up their plan for living and accept God's plan for their life. At the end of each week, there is a page for the reader to write down reflections about what they have learned during the week. This book is a workbook, as well as an inspirational guide. It is easy to follow and also includes a discussion guide at the end.As I read this book, I began to really feel Christ's presence. I felt as though my deep personal and spiritual needs were being met. A greater power than my own became available to me as I continued this study and my life feels more complete because of it. God has plans for me, if I will take the time to really listen to and understand his word. What a treasure this Bible study has become to me! If you grew up knowing about Jesus, but now wish to truly know Him, then you will find this study to be a wonderfully moving journey. It will help you to build your life on the strong foundation of the Lord's word. I have the highest praise for Kelley Latta's ministry. She has made a difference in my life and I pray she will make a difference in yours, as well.I received a copy of this book from the author, through The Book Club Network (bookfun.org) in exchange for my honest review.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5152u6qRacL.jpg

Thinking it would be a good read, and because I always enjoy Amish fiction, I was anxious to start this novel.The story is unlike other Amish fiction I've read. It's well written and very unique. However, I discovered that this is the third book in a series of four by this author. I did not read the first two books and was rather lost and confused while reading this one. There is a preface which briefly describes the plot and character through books one and two, but it is too brief. There are many characters in the novel who seemed to suddenly pop up without explanation.The main characters are involved in a &#34;love triangle&#34; from the start of the story. I could not really connect with any of them, so I can't say that I really enjoyed this book. Perhaps, if I had read the first two books, I might have enjoyed book three.That being said, based on this book alone, I do not have any interest in reading the rest of the series. The entire story seems to build to a very sudden and disconnected ending. It just never came together for me and I was disappointed.I do appreciate having the opportunity to read and review this book, but it simply did not hold my interest.

Having heard it was quite good, I thought I might find it to be of interest. Saving Amelie goes far beyond interesting! It is a story which is deeply moving, historically accurate, heartbreaking, and even horrifying, all at the same time. Truly a novel about what was good and what was very evil during the dark days of the Nazi regime in Germany.Amelie is the focus of the story. The daughter of one of Hitler's SS Agents, she was born deaf. Her father despises her imperfection and wants to be rid of the child and also his wife, Kristine, the one who gave birth to an inferior child.Rachel Kramer is an American woman who is friends with Amelie's mother, Kristine. Her father is a scientist who has been doing eugenics research for the Nazis. Together, Rachel and her father travel to Germany. While there, her friend, Kristine, begs her to take Amelie away so that the child will not be killed. Rachel agrees to save Amelie. In doing so she discovers much about her own life which shocks her.As she takes Amelie into hiding, an American journalist, Jason Young, assists Rachel and they settle in the town of Oberammergau, famous for it's Passion Play. While trying to outwit the SS, Rachel finds family, love, and faith in the small village.There is so much more to this novel, but I don't want to give away too much of the story. There are many other characters in the book, some who actually lived during the time period. The entire plot is excellent and well researched, and will keep the reader turning the pages.In conclusion, Saving Amelie is a wonderful story about a terrible time in history.

I have become a fan of her novels, always expecting a great read, and A Beauty So Rare does not disappoint! This story is set in Nashville, at the Belmont Mansion in the aftermath of the Civil War. Adelicia Acklen is the mistress of Belmont and actually is a real person who was considered to be American Royalty throughout the South during the 19th Century.The main character in this story is Eleanor Braddock. She is not a typical southern belle, and thinks of herself as plain and unappealing. Her life recently took a downward spiral, as so many lives did because of the war. Adelicia Acklen is Eleanor's aunt, by marriage. She invites Eleanor to live with her and expects her to be swept into her high society lifestyle. She also wants to settle her niece into a married life with an appropriate suitor. Eleanor is never comfortable with that, and is more concerned with those less fortunate. When she arrives at Belmont, Eleanor meets Marcus Geoffrey. He is employed by Adelicia and has a serious interest in botany. Marcus works on developing beautiful plants and flowers for the estate. He is also an architect and has dreams of building a grand and beautiful public building in Nashville. Thos dreams are dashed. Eleanor also has dreams, less grand, of opening a restaurant, which her aunt crushes. A lady of society would never consider cooking for others. It is simply not done! Both Eleanor and Marcus are also hiding secrets from their past. Marcus is not who he seems to be and is hiding his true identity. Eleanor does not want him to find out about her true circumstances in life. They both understand that they can't allow themselves to fall in love. Their hearts do not hold the same understanding.Eleanor and Marcus are fascinated with each other and enjoy being in each other's company. The plot takes many turns and through it all, Marcus and Eleanor find they are, indeed, falling in love. It is a nearly impossible situation, yet they continue to depend on one another and become more and more emotionally entangled. Will their secrets be revealed? If they are, will Eleanor and Marcus be able to reconcile their pasts and find a life together? The deceit may be too much for both of them to work through. They may be forced to deny their true feelings and return to the duties and expectations waiting for them and be forever parted.This is the second novel in the Belmont Mansion Series. Some characters reappear in A Beauty So Rare, but you do not need to have read the first book to enjoy the second. However, once you read one of Tamera Alexander's novels, you will want to read all of them. She is a talented writer and always delivers a very enjoyable read.I received an advance reading copy of this book from Bethany House, courtesy of Library Thing's Early Reviewers group.

Sometimes we even question God's reasons for allowing bad things to happen. When we really need comfort, we need to know how to pray. This book gives the reader a kind of &#34;road map&#34; with directions on reaching out to God during difficult times.In this book, you will find prayers for many different circumstances. There is also a Bible Study at the end of the book which reviews each chapter and asks the reader to answer questions about what they have read. Some of the chapters include help with praying for hope and healing, turning over your troubles to God, and finding peace through prayer.

Woman of Courage is outstanding and is now my favorite by this author! Usually writing about the Amish culture, in her latest book, Wanda has taken on a story about the Quaker faith and the American West. A new area for her, but a wonderfully written novel! The historical detail is excellent and the story itself is deeply inspirational!Amanda Pearson is jilted by her fiance on the eve of her wedding. Convinced that she will lead a solitary life from that point on, she convinces her father to travel west to a Nez Perce settlement in order to introduce them to Christ. This becomes her mission now that she has vowed to remain single.During their trip across the country, they are met with hardships and tragedy. Amanda nearly dies, but is rescued by Buck McFadden. He is half Indian and takes her to the cabin of his trapper friend, Jim, who is married to an Indian woman named Mary. Amanda forms a bond with Mary and converts her to Christianity. Later, after his son's birth, Jim also accepts Christ into his life. Mary and Jim's story is wonderful in itself and adds to the depth of the novel.Meanwhile, Buck comes back into Amanda's life as her journey continues. Amanda develops deep feelings for Buck. Buck also cares for Amanda and can't seem to forget her, but he is a bitter man scarred by his past. He refuses to even consider Christianity as a choice in his life. This is a heartbreaking challenge for Amanda. Buck's lack of faith makes it impossible for her to consider allowing herself to fall in love with him.Amanda truly is a woman of great courage. Will that be enough to sustain her? Will her abiding faith be enough to change Buck and lead him to Christ? Will they overcome their differences and find love? You must read this book to discover the answers...and it is a MUST READ!Woman of Courage is well written and deeply moving.

Tucker is very controlling and expects others to follow his orders. Jess is headstrong and independent. No man will tell her what to do. Regardless of their differences, they are attracted to one another. It was interesting to watch the plot unfold and to find out if Tucker and Jess would finally realize that they had grown to care deeply for each other. Plots and Pans was a good story.All that being said, I am giving 3 stars to what might have been a 5-Star review. While I liked the story very much, I did not like the author's writing style. As I read the first few chapters, I noticed that the dialogue was repeated as each chapter transitioned into the next.I found myself stopping to think &#34;Didn't I just read that?&#34; and then wondering &#34;Why?,&#34; so I turned back to find out if I had missed something which would explain the repeating text. At first I thought the book was poorly edited, but as I continued through to the end of the novel, I realized it was the author's intent to transition the chapters in this way.I did not enjoy the book as much because of this. It caused me to lose my focus far too often. To me, that made the book feel &#34;choppy&#34; and disconnected. I've never before seen this issue in a book. It really bothered me.In conclusion, the storyline would be worth 5 stars had the author written it in an easier to read, more free flowing style. Maybe other readers can overlook the unusual dialogue transitions and enjoy the novel. I could not.I received this book from the publisher, through The Book Club Network (bookfun.org) in exchange for my honest review.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51dtiwp3ueL.jpg

She had a sweet, infectious personality, and I immediately wanted to support someone that seemed positive, as I thought that would likely come out in her writing. I was right.I received &#8220;Blame It On The Fame&#8221; and was shocked at the size of the book. At almost 400 pages, I thought it would take me forever to finish it. I was wrong. It took less than four days for me to devour this book. And I mean DEVOUR. I hated putting it down and rushed through my work (as much as I could) in order to return to reading. Although it was almost 400 pages long, I did not think there was one scene that could be cut. It actually was a fast read, and one I enjoyed immensely.Without giving away too many details&#8230;the story chronicles five actresses nominated for the Best Actress Award at the Oscars. The chapters are written from the perspective of each of the five actresses leading up to the awards ceremony. Because of this, the first couple of chapters confused me. I thought I was going to have a difficult time keeping each actress and accompanying storyline straight. However, by the second set of chapters written in the language of each character, I understood and was hooked. It was like a mini-soap opera in print, which was fun, engaging, and actually made me laugh out loud a few times.I am glad I&#8217;ve already purchased Tracie&#8217;s other book, as I enjoyed her style of writing and am looking forward to reading &#8220;In Need of Therapy.&#8221; If you want to read something that will draw you into the story and make you feel like you&#8217;re in the room with the characters, Blame It On The Fame is your book!

Absolutely none of that falls into my normal genre of novel, but I read Scott&#8217;s inspiration to write the book (link below) and decided it was worth my time to check it out.Wow. This book was GOOD. The book is the whole package &#8211; romance, plot, tastefully written and steamy sex scenes, and exceptional dialogue. True, most men do not talk like Shane Dekkar, the main character. Although, I would argue that maybe most men should talk like him.Without divulging too much information, Shane is a new-to-town boxer who happens to see Kace arguing with her boyfriend. He later runs into Kace and finds out her boyfriend is the world&#8217;s ultimate jerk. And&#8230;that&#8217;s all I&#8217;m saying because you HAVE to read this book.Undefeated was a quick read for me. I read the whole thing in less than a day &#8211; not because it&#8217;s a short book but because I was that drawn into the story. I fell in love with the vulnerability of the characters, the desire to help each other, and the overall sense of warmth in the story.

However, I was VERY wrong. It took one chapter in the first book for me to be hooked, which is pretty early for me. I immediately felt a kindred spirit with Presley. Having gone through similar things, I identified with her early on. I love her determination and her independence, yet her complete ability (eventually) to depend on her chosen family. Lorcan was easy to adore, as his complete infatuation with Presley was genuinely heartfelt. The remainder of the characters are just as lovable and easy to read as Presley and Lorcan.I thought this book was extremely well written.

It was seamless, and I can't imagine the story being told any other way.While this review is spoiler-free, I will tell you that the story was gut-wrenching at times.

I wanted to step into the world and give Wrynn and Liam a big hug or help Wrynn clean her house and take care of the kids.

You are able to connect with each main character, and it adds a great deal of depth to the story, almost as if you are sitting in the room with the characters watching the story unfold. I do not usually get emotionally invested in book characters; however, this was one major exception.

From the sexual innuendos to the funny storylines (sorry, no spoilers here) to Marley's desire to want to find a guy that meets all of her criteria - only she doesn't have a clear idea of that criteria herself - all of these things make you want Marley as a bestie, Will as your boyfriend, and a sister as awesome as Bethany. For me, the addition of cute and cuddly animals, like Magoo from the Humane Society, just made my heart love the story and the characters so much more.Bottom line - you totally need to read this book!

Since poetry is straight from the heart, all I can do is tell you my heartfelt reaction to the poems in this collection. Reviewing poetry is a bit like reviewing the poet's soul, and in this case, I'd have to say Yates' soul is pure, beautiful, and compassionate. The poems are divided into different sections, and I was able to choose favorites from each, though it was impossible to narrow it down to just one or two.I particularly connected with &#34;A Warriors Call&#34;, which is a lovely tribute to men an women in uniform.&#34;The False Treasure in Life&#34; was another poem I flagged to read again and again. It talks about our society's obsession with acquiring things and how people replace true bounty (love, friendship, nature) with useless things. This is something I've contemplated numerous times, and Yates expresses her thoughts in a very clear and honest manner.&#34;She Who Rides the Wind&#34; is a very spiritual poem, and one I believe has great meaning to the author. It evokes the image of untamed land and the purity of nature.There are too many poems in the collection for me to pay homage to. I can honestly say I enjoyed them all. While reading, I could feel the poet's emotions in each piece. From fun and whimsical, to spiritual, to heart-wrenching, there is a little something for everyone in this collection.

He loves being in the thick of the action. What he doesn't enjoy is having to work with Mollie, his determined, difficult partner. Mollie isn't too thrilled with her partner either. She sees Pierce as a distraction, and the idea of living in close quarters with him is infuriating. Will their mutual attraction get in their way of finishing their assignment, or will desire and love win over all?This book is a bit different from the other books in the MacLarens of Fire Mountain series, but it still remains true to the core values in the series. Why is it different? Because this is probably the most complex book the author has written so far. As Pierce, Mollie, and their team uncover deep, dark secrets among San Francisco's most prominent business people, the plot twists and turns until there isn't a single character outside of the core team that the reader can trust. Almost everyone is suspected of having some ulterior motive. The author also delves into some of the political turmoil happening the nation during this historical period in time.

I can't get enough of this series or the characters. I love that the author brings starring characters from previous books into the current novel to remind us of how close-knit the family is.

The brothers and cousins (and Aunt Alicia) aren't opposed to taking a loved one to task when it's needed. But that's what real family is all about. And the MacLarens are that kind of family--the kind who sticks together, stands up for each other, works to create a ranch where everyone has a place, and celebrates each new addition to the clan, whether it's a new baby, a new daughter-in-law, or a long-lost cousin they hardly know.I give Wilder than the Rest (and the series as a whole) five stars.

As Poppy's feelings for Austin grow, she's torn between elation that she's finally moving on, and guilt for leaving her old life behind.

She stops having to remind herself to move forward as the book goes on. The author did a wonderful job showing a gradual progression in Poppy's character.

Even though she's rich and seems to have every advantage, she isn't snobbish or afraid of hard work.As for the other characters in the book, I liked them all. Poppy's parents are the ultimate gracious Southern couple who have nothing but love and concern for their daughter. Even her in-laws want to see her move on and be happy. It's beautiful to see the way these families pull together to help Poppy take steps toward adjusting to life without her husband. Poppy is very lucky to have supportive friends and family, and she's found a true friend in Austin. He's very patient with her, and even though he wants to take their relationship to the next level, he holds back for her sake.The Golden Apple deals with loss, grief, friendship, love, and family ties. I would definitely recommend this book to fans of women's fiction, chick-lit, or romance. If you're looking for clean romance, this is the book for you.Note: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review",4.0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-t4-VovPL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"

This book was the most unique, original, exciting, gripping, edgy book I've read in a long time. Maybe ever. Dimitri is a slave to the Walker family. Well, not exactly a slave--he's a genie. Forget everything you've ever learned about genies. Forget about three wishes and rubbing bottles. Rainy Kaye's concept of genies is WAY more sophisticated that all that. This isn't Aladdin, kids. In fact, this isn't a book for kids at all. Full of steamy sex, violence, high speed chases, mind numbing pain, romance, and Arabic mythology, Summoned is strictly for adult readers.When I began reading the book, I expected it to be good. After all, it came recommended by some readers and authors whose opinions I respect. But, wow! I honestly didn't expect for it to be THAT good. It exceeded all my expectations and more. Summoned is truly unlike anything I've ever read. The author has set the bar really, really high for paranormal/fantasy writers.Dimitri has kidnapped, murdered, and destroyed. But, despite all that, he's completely charming and likable. Everything he's done has been at the command of his master. For Dimitri to disobey is impossible. Or is it? When he meets Syd, he begins to imagine a life of his own. For the first time, he wonders what it would be like to leave the Walkers. He begins to question his assignments. And, he begins to question who he really is. Syd is bold, brilliant, and has secrets of her own.

Though I've enjoyed some Civil War fiction in the past, I'm not usually a fan of conspiracy theories. This story gripped me early on, probably because of the author's skill in crafting sympathetic, likable characters. I enjoyed the human element in this story and the author's ability to show the toll the war took on the country. As the country begins to take sides in the war, states battle neighboring states, brothers war against brothers, and families are ripped apart. The story focuses on certain characters (Aaron Thackery, Jacob Thackery, Miles, and others), but also explores the war as a whole and is interspersed with historical facts that bring the time period to life.This story is very well-written.

There is a beautiful, magical quality to this tale and I'll definitely read the next book in the series.I'd give this book 4.5 stars out of 5 because there are parts where it could have been edited better.

She's taken to Wildewood against her will, and it isn't long before Grace realizes exactly how much danger she's in. In a world where women are in need of protection, where the smallest accusation can result in cries of witchcraft, where modern conveniences are hundreds of years in the future, Grace must tread very carefully. The struggle to survive soon replaces her thoughts of escape, and in the midst of all the intrigue, danger, and betrayal, Grace begins to discover a feeling of belonging she never felt at home.Wildewood Revenge is a beautifully written historical novel with strong elements of romance, adventure, mystery, and fantasy. I was immediately captivated by the setting--the thick wilderness, the smell of damp earth and  wood smoke, the sounds of Wildewood coming alive again after Miles' long absence. I love the author's ability to flesh out believable, flawed, multifaceted characters. Grace is headstrong and brave, but hurt and vulnerable underneath her forthright veneer. She's her own worst enemy and often finds herself trusting the wrong people. Miles is hardworking, kind, and commands respect, but too caught up in revenge. The chemistry between Miles and Grace is explosive in more ways than one, and their relationship develops gradually as they learn to trust one another. The secondary characters in this novel are a delight--adorable Linus, loyal John, outspoken Martha, and even scheming Belle. Edmund is an enigma. There's definitely more to him than meets the eye. And Hugh--I'm not sure if I trust him, and neither is Grace. As for the more obvious villains, Morton has crafted two antagonists who torment Grace and Miles throughout the book. One is truly evil; the other is as obsessed with vengeance as Miles.I enjoyed this well-researched book and can't wait to get my hands on the next book in the series. I'm usually not a fan of cliff-hanger endings, but for this book, I'll make an exception. It truly is an exceptional story, one which has all the makings of an epic series.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/712N-ajILsL.jpg

I stayed up all night completely absorbed in these books. I'd read The Hunger Games in the past, but hadn't made time to read the entire series until just recently. Let me break down my review for each book individually...The Hunger Games--I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could. Even though this was my second reading, I couldn't tear myself away. The usage of present tense sometimes feels awkward to me, but in this case, it was very well done and gave the book a feeling of tension and immediacy. The brutality of the book (kids killing kids, Capitol-dwellers watching murder as entertainment) is shocking, but not too shocking if you consider our society's thirst for reality shows. Could something like this really happen? Is it really such a stretch? These are questions I pondered long after I finished reading the book.Catching Fire--This was another 5+++ book. During this book, I was captivated by the political undertones, the cruelty of President Snow, and Katniss's growing love for Peeta. Katniss might feel conflicted, but actions speak louder than words. It's clear she's head over heels in love with Peeta. Too bad the developing romance had to be cut short. The ending in this book is so powerful. Thank goodness I had the trilogy, because I immediately began to read the next story. Talk about a cliff-hanger.Mockingjay--This book was great, but I don't think I loved it as much as the first two books. Maybe it was too depressing. Everything Katniss has been through has taken too much of a toll. She's damaged. Could the author have made things a bit neater and nicer? Happier? No, not without being unrealistic. Fact if, war is ugly. The killing of innocent children is atrocious. For me, the end was somewhat predictable. Not all of it, but the fate of the leader of District 13. President Coin and her regimented district creeped me out from the beginning. Overall, it was a riveting read. Thankfully, there's hope at the end, but it's tarnished by Katniss's lingering sadness.Would I read this series again? You betcha.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71dzQSHITcL.jpg

In the time I've written this review, I've changed my star rating several times. Considering how many times I almost stopped reading the book, I thought about give it two stars. But, there are aspects of the book that are very, very good and I think both the series and the author have amazing potential. I think the book would have benefitted from an experienced, no-nonsense editor, not because of grammatical or structural errors (there were very few), but because of other, more serious issues.The writing style seems middle grade with simplistic descriptions and short sentences, but the book is intended for young adults. If it wasn't for some sexual innuendo and bad language, I'd say the book could be marketed for younger readers. Indeed, the main character who is an older teen acts like a twelve or thirteen year old much of the time. And so do some of the other characters. They talk about &#34;doing it&#34; in regards to Brooklyn/Princess Sophie consummating her marriage and at one point, she mentions that Prince Algrid looks &#34;awesome.&#34; As the mother of three teens, some of Brooklyn's behavior did not seem age appropriate, but I think she would appeal to preteens (if it wasn't for the bad language and light sexual situations).The other issue I had with the story--and one of the reasons I almost stopped reading several times--is stilted dialogue and out of place slang. I could understand why Ryder might use some American slang because he was in America for a short time. But some of the Necohian characters used cliches and slang that seemed very out of place in their world. It pulled me out of the story every time.Much of this review has been spent nitpicking this story to death (I could go on), but let me focus on what worked for me, and why I kept reading. The author is very inventive. She's created a rich, detailed work (Necoh) including other-worldly creatures, magic flowers, curses, kingdoms, villains--her imagination seems limitless. The author also understands that a manipulative, conniving villain is much more frightening than a mindless beast who eats people just because. Grishma is truly an evil monster, and much more terrifying because she's able to plot, plan, and obtain power. There were several aspects of this book that deserved four or five stars.Though I really struggled with the first half of the novel, the second half zipped by. By the last 20% of the book, it was hard to put it down because I wanted to know what happened, but I did find myself skimming through some of the long descriptions of what people ate, or wore, or how rooms in the castle looked. When it got down to the action, the book was quite engaging.I suspect the author (and hopefully editor) will grow and improve as the series continues. As it stands right now, I probably wouldn't pay for the next book, but I would be willing to read on if I could find the books in the library. Overall, I think there are young teens who would enjoy the series.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/71JQxUPCV3L.jpg

When I began reading, I honestly didn't think I'd finish the book. I figured I'd need to read at least the first novel in the series before I could relate to the various characters in the short story collection. Needless to say, I was wrong. From the very first page, I was immediately drawn in to Joleene Naylor's world. The characters were engaging, and each story tied into another in some way. We meet vengeful killers, philosophical vamps, young brides yearning for love, children, mothers, and innocent victims who can scarcely remember how they became vampires.And the writing? Holy cow. This author can write. I'm a fan of Stephen King and Anne Rice. It takes a lot for a horror author to impress me. The reason I'm comparing this author with King and Rice is because she is every bit as good a writer as these two masters of the genre. Naylor's vampires aren't the lovestruck sparkly vamps that haunt high school hallways--these are complex characters with multifaceted personalities. Some are cruel and vicious, others are only doing what they need to do to survive.I would highly recommend this book to vampire and horror lovers. I'm definitely sold on the Amaranthine world and can't wait to take a bite out of Shades of Gray (Book one in the series).",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51lauf%2BM70L.jpg

When Heath tells Annie that he's considering entering a serious relationship, she has no choice but to face her true feelings for Heath.

The MacLarens are fiercely dedicated to family, their community, and their ranch. They work hard, play hard, and love with all their hearts. Though the characters are often flawed and sometimes get sidetracked on their path to finding true love, these are men and women I care about and root for.

In the second half of the book, he talks about the craft and gives authors tips on how to make their writing better than ever. If you're not really into memoirs and writing guides, have no fear.

The author did a great job of creating a fantasy world where magic is normal, though often not accepted. The plot was simple, but seeing as how this is a novella and not a full length novel, anything more complex would have been confusing. I thought the pacing was good with a great build up to the ending. The reason I didn't rate the book higher was because I found myself distracted and confused by the writing. The writing style is very straightforward and seemed like it was meant for young teens, but there were numerous sex scenes that were definitely not intended for a younger audience. Though this book is not marketed toward the YA audience, the stark contrast between the youthful writing and characters, and the intimate scenes was jarring. Of course, this is only my opinion.

A group claiming to be Children of Shadows is bombing vampire strongholds, while another secret organization claims to oppose them. After being held against their will in Munich, Jorick and Katelina escape only to find themselves plunged into intrigue and danger. They're swept along from continent to continent, intent on getting to the bottom of who is leading the Children of Shadows. Is Malick the ring-leader, or is the newly awakened Samael the one who resurrected the evil group? And, most importantly, who keeps invading Katelina's thoughts and dreams?I know I keep saying each book is the best one yet, but that's because each book gets better and better. Children of Shadows is a very strong sixth book in the series, a book that sets up the series for the most exciting plot-line yet. This book centers around Cyprus, Malick, and Samael--three dangerous vampires with their own unique goals. Cyprus is focused on revenge, while Malick craves turmoil and power. Samael's ultimate goals are unknown to Jorick and Katelina, and this makes him the most dangerous adversary of all. While forces within Katelina drives her to greater strength and bravery, she is probably the most vulnerable she's been throughout the series.One of my favorite aspects of this book was the underlying fear inspired by Samael who is always on the periphery of Katelina's thoughts and fears. There are hints that Katelina isn't quite the same since she consumed the ancient vampire's blood at the end of book five, but even Jorick and Verchiel can't quite figure out the ultimate effects.In terms of character development, this book has a lot going on. Katelina's relationship with the other characters evolves, particularly with Sadhira, Loren, Oren, Etsuko, and even Torina. Even the more prickly of her vampire companions (Micah) has grudging respect for her, as she's proven herself in more ways than one. There's a great scene with Loren and Micah where Katelina shows her devotion and love for the vampires who have been a part of her life.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this book, just like I've enjoyed the entire series. The author's talent in creating this detailed world and tying multiple characters and plot lines together is astounding. If you're looking for a series to fall in love with, this is it. With six full-length books, several short story collections, and a blog dedicated to the series, being an Amaranthine fan is truly an experience.

I don't read many memoirs, but I'm certainly glad I read this book by Arlene R. O'Neil. Touching, heartbreaking, and ultimately inspiring, Broken Spokes follows the life of the author as she copes with a life-altering disease and the life-long repercussions.The story begins at a carefree place in Arlene's life--her happy family life, typical sibling rivalry, good times with her best friend, and sheer joy at getting the bike of her dreams. When a tragic accident leads to the discovery of a crippling illness, Arlene must leave the love and security of her home. She is diagnosed with Legg-Perthes disease, and in the early 1960s, the only &#34;cure&#34; was for the patient to spend all their time in braces, unable to put any weight on the affected leg and hip.Arlene is sent to home for crippled children where she quickly learns the rules of her new home. Don't walk, don't talk past bedtime, don't make noise, don't cry--these words not only structure her days, but they become a mantra she repeats throughout her life. Arlene feels like an invalid, an inconvenience, a burden on those she loves. When a nurse tells her not to upset her parents, she takes this advice to heart and begins to trap her feelings deep inside her, and it's years before those feelings break free. There are moments of joy in this book, but those fleeting episodes are tempered with Arlene's fears. Even when she's released from the children's home, she still has much healing to do--physically and emotionally.This story often had me in tears as I became caught up in Arlene's life. Broken Spokes is written simply, but beautifully and reads in such a way that I felt like I was living the author's life right beside her. The author doesn't dwell on pain, nor does she feel sorry for herself as she tells her tale. She is upfront, honest, and inspiring. Arlene's journey from a broken child to an adult who uses her life's challenges to help others is truly worth reading. She reminds us of how important feelings are and that we must never, ever tell a child not suppress their emotions. We must never tell our children not to cry. Thank you, Arlene, for sharing our story with the world.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21YrQBGLWDL.jpg

She isn't thrilled with being an outcast, but she's accepted her grim reality and is determined to make the best of things. And when she finally finds the one person who makes her feel human, she's determined to hold on to him. She learns to accept her paranormal curse and cultivates her powers, turning her curse into a gift she can wield at will. I enjoyed watching her evolve and grow as a character.This book contains some very graphic violence and sexual scenes. As stated in the product description, this book is NOT recommended for readers under eighteen. As the parent of teens and young adults, I know darned well most high school students are exposed to sex and violence on television, movies, and in the hallways at school, but I'd at least use caution before choosing this book for kids under sixteen. For anyone over the eighteen who does not have tender sensibilities, this book is a must read.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QNwxjahaL.jpg

As they grow up, their social circle expands, sometimes including unsavory characters intent on dragging them down. Their early adult lives are marred by the gangsters and drugs  which eventually shape all their lives in very different ways. Sheila is a level-headed, career-driven woman who becomes a model. Though she could settle down with any number of men (movie stars, race car drivers), she can't keep her mind off John, her university crush whose strict made-up rules come between them. Phil has a solid moral backbone, but has blinders on when it comes to Davy. She's willing to overlook her own sense of right and wrong, and even willing to lose everything, to protect her lover. Mary succumbs early on to the lure of drugs and partying, but finds happiness in spirituality. The three friends live very separate lives, but always seem to find their way back to each other, with their friendships not only intact, but stronger than ever.From the very start, Belfast Girls was a book I couldn't put down. By the end of the book, I loved the main female characters as if they were my own best friends, and I felt as if I'd known them all my life. I was very sad to see the book end. Though I did not like John through much of the book, he showed his true colors when it counted and redeemed himself in my eyes. Through self-reflection, John matures and changes.The author weaves history and facts about the region into her tale, and I feel like I learned something while being entertained. I enjoy realistic books that explore human nature, and this book was perfect. McCullough's characters undergo tremendous character development as they navigate tragedy, disappointment, heartbreak, and success. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well-written book with top notch characters, an engrossing plot, and beautiful storytelling.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51eblsFmvEL.jpg

In a normal world, they would have earned a much-needed rest, but in the dangerous world they live in, peace is impossible. When Katelina tries to reconcile her past with her future, she finds herself faced with her greatest challenge yet. Ties of Blood takes us into the heart of vampire hierarchy when Jorick, Katelina, and Oren are summoned to face Malick. It seems terror lurks around every corner as a new, frightening stalker is bent on destroying Katelina.This is my favorite book so far. In contrast to the dark nature in Legacy of Ghosts, there are lots of humorous moments in this book. With the introduction of Verchiel, Ties of Blood reaches new levels of awesome. Verchiel is a smart-ass Executioner who takes orders from The Guild, but puts his own, bad-ass twist on everything he does. By far, he's one of my favorite characters in the series. Is Jorick a little jealous of the attention Verchiel pays Katelina? It seems so. Jorick is enraged every time he sees the redhead Executioner. But Jorick's rage doesn't compare with the anger we see in Oren. The blond fledgling is hellbent on waging war with The Guild even if it costs him his life.I could not put this book down.

He's in love with Tess, the quiet daughter of a Rancher, but won't ask for her hand until he can walk again. Tess believes she's the only one who can help him, and she's determined to be there for him, even when he pushes her away. When Drew's job forces him to return to the site of his crippling injury, he discovers danger still lurks within the Colorado town.Stronger Than the Rest is the fourth book in The MacLarens of Fire Mountain Series. While I can't say it's my favorite (because I couldn't possibly choose between them), I can say this is by far the most complex and fast-paced story of them all. This book is non-stop action, passionate romance, and heart-clutching danger all rolled into one amazing package. It's definitely a page-turner! With the introduction of a cold-hearted, greedy villain who will destroy anyone to get what he wants, the tension oozes from every page. There are characters who aren't who they seem to be, and a mysterious spy working behind the scenes. In the midst of all this danger, there's a romance brewing between Drew and Tess. Drew struggles with the fear that he isn't good enough for the woman he loves while trying to do the job he has set out to do.Drew is a courageous, honorable character, and it's no wonder. The entire MacLaren family is made up of unforgettably unique characters I can't get enough of. I love the way this family bands together and supports each other in any situation. I've mentioned this in my reviews of previous books, but it's worth mentioning again--there is something very special about this series, and it isn't just the romance. If you're a romance lover, you'll enjoy the blossoming love that develops in each MacLaren novel. If romance isn't your thing, there's enough action and intrigue to keep you engaged (particularly in books three and four). If you're a reader who wants to discover an entire family of characters you can fall in love with, this is the series for you. It's the family that makes this series truly special. There's a feeling of love--not just romantic love, but love between brothers, love between parents and children, love for the land, love for your neighbors--the kind of real, enduring love that's missing from many romance novels I've read. These are characters who are often flawed, but have strong work ethics and solid moral values. They embrace fun and family while enduring tragedy and sharing tears.This series is a definite favorite I will read over and over again.",5.0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YB5eNC4WL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"

If this isn't bad enough, her best friend stops speaking to her, she's being followed, and she's about to find out the truth about her heritage. Yes, things are about to get much, much worse for Sophia.I love anything supernatural and The Forever Girl is about as good as it gets. The author has created a paranormal world that's captivating and fascinating, one the reader can get lost in. Sophia's world is dark, spooky, and magical and when I read the book, I felt as if I was right there with her. I loved the author's attention to detail and the respectful way she dealt with Sophia's Wiccan rituals. I also enjoyed the intricate rules and hierarchy of the supernatural beings which exist within the pages of this book. I can sympathize with Sophia's struggle to determine who she can trust and her desire to find out the truth about her family's past. As she learns to accept and use her abilities, her self-confidence grows in a very satisfying way. I loved watching her evolve as a character.The Forever Girl is extremely well-written with an airtight plot and flawless pacing. I appreciate the fact that this novel is self-contained with a satisfying ending while still leaving lots of room for the series to expand. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone who's looking for something different. I can understand why this book has been optioned for film.

They've been on the run from city to city, finally ending up in Ellen's hometown. The voices in Clare's head have always been there, but now there's a menacing voice insinuating itself into mind and Clare is determined to find out who it belongs to. She's used to be assailed by the thoughts of others, so when she meets the first person whose thoughts are hidden from her, she wants to know more about the enigmatic Daniel. It seems Daniel has secrets of his own and his destiny is tied with hers.I got this book for free on Kindle and I really feel like I should have paid for it. Indeed, I definitely plan to purchase the next book in the series. This book was good, but I have to compare it to Twilight. There are no vampires in this book, but The Watchers invokes that dreamlike feeling you get from Twilight, and the author is masterful in describing the setting so I felt like I right there in the forest, or driving through the small town. There are a few scenes and situations in the book that reminded me of Twilight as well--Daniel being the only person whose thought are blocked from Clare, Clare calling her mom by her first name, Clare's mom being sort of childlike and helpless.If you loved Twilight, you'll love this book. If you didn't love Twilight, you'll still like The Watchers. Why? Because the author created a strong, believable heroine with a good moral foundation, the desire to help others, and powers of her own. As for the hero, he's cute, mysterious, and totally into Clare. Daniel doesn't want to control Clare, nor does he want to keep her in the dark about things that might directly affect her. Though the storyline isn't super original, it's still a very refreshing take on YA paranormal because the characters are top notch.This was a very entertaining story that I would recommend to paranormal lovers.

She's from a &#34;good&#34; family, is educated, highly intelligent, and confident. She doesn't seem the type who would go back to her abuser, or who would miss him once she was separated from him. But this is what Riley does. Because it can happen to anyone, even to those you would least expect. As the author delves into Riley's past and her family life, we uncover elements of dysfunction that might lead to future unhealthy relationships, but isn't that true for almost all of us? We all have issues and baggage. Why is it some of us end up in abusive relationships while others do not? Abusers and their victims don't always fit a certain mold, and this is one of the most thought-provoking themes in this novel.We meet and get to know Ben--the abusive boyfriend. We find out about his past and what might have led to his outbursts of anger. And, we learn enough about him that while we might not condone his behavior, we can have compassion for him as a human being. We also meet Riley's parents, her best friends, and her brother. We meet Ben's mother and discover her hidden pain.I'm so appreciative of the way O'Rourke tackled the issue of domestic abuse. I've read works of fiction that have tried to explore this issue, but most rely on stereotypes. The meek victim cowering in the corner, believing she deserves the abuse because she grew up watching it happen to her own mother. The cruel abuser taking delight in tormenting his victim. Sure, victims and abusers like these exist, but it's important to show the reality of domestic abuse. Not all victims are the same. Not all abusers are the same. There are various shades of domestic abuse. It's not all black and white.This book is not all about abuse. It's about relationships between families, friends, and significant others. It's about secrets, hard decisions, and dealing with depression and trauma. It's an emotional read without being over-the-top. The dramatic scenes are realistic and believable. And even the author deals with some pretty heavy issues, there's hope for the future as we watch Riley evolve and grow.There's so much about this novel that was spectacular. It's a book that stays with you, and changes you just a little bit. This is another one of those books I wish I would have read as part of a book club.

Her husband takes her for granted. She can't say no to the constant barrage of requests to volunteer, bake, and organize. She moves through life in constant reactive mode, averting crises, soothing boo-boos, cleaning messes, but not doing a single thing to nurture her own soul.If you're a mom, chances are you'll immediately sympathize with Elizabeth. My kids are now older, but I clearly remember the days when I was so overwhelmed as a working mom of four kids, that I felt like I was on the constant verge of losing it. Elizabeth is completely unappreciated by her husband, and were times I used to feel the same way. She feels obligated to join the &#34;mom clique&#34; at her kids' school, pitching in to help at every PTA activity imaginable. Though I never really succumbed to that particular urge, I was a Scout mom for a number of years, so I'm familiar with this type of phenomenon. Moms constantly try to one-up each other by comparing their busy schedules. There's a very real pressure in our society for moms to be the busiest, the most active in PTA, the most organized. These moms wear their stress and lack of sleep as badges of honor, as if they've achieved an amazing feat by sacrificing their lives to the constant pursuit of perfection. In mom cliques, women never brag about personal or professional achievements--it's all about who has the most hectic schedule, or who's juggling the most balls in the air.But I digress... Back to the book. Needless to say, I connected with this book very strongly. It was very moving and the message within the pages is one that needs to be heard: There is nothing honorable about sacrificing your own needs. There is nothing honorable about forgoing sleep, spiritual nourishment, and personal fulfillment in order to satisfy the expectations of others. Moms are people. We have to take care of ourselves before we can take care of anyone else. As Elizabeth learns to care about herself in this book, she suffers a serious setback--a setback that eventually propels her to even greater personal growth. A blast from her past writes a 50-Shades type book and it isn't long before everyone in town is wondering about Elizabeth's personal life. With her reputation, marriage, and sanity hanging in the balance, Elizabeth must fight for what's really important.So, what's not to love about this book? Well, for me, the beginning was just okay. I wish the back story would have been integrated into the book at a later stage instead of lumped at the beginning. The only reason I mention this is because some readers might be put off by the slow start. Please don't be! You've got to read this book. Despite the rocky start, this book scored an easy five stars. I couldn't put the book down once I got into it and thought about Elizabeth for days after. The plot is outstanding, the characterization perfect. Hold Her Down is one of those books I wish I would have read as part of a book club. This is a book that will definitely spark some lively discussion.Please give this book a try. You'll be glad you did.(Note: I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review)",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-D%2ByirleL.jpg

The story takes a brutally honest look at the lives of impoverished young adults and teens from a tough New Zealand neighborhood. The author explores drug addiction, violence, sexual assault, sexual abuse, poverty, gang culture, and the ties that bind families and friends together. While some of these characters are loathsome, many are just victims of life. Some, like Tama, move through life like wild animals, ruled by the desire for drink, drugs, and sex. Others struggle to raise children the best way they know how. This book is realism at its finest. Though the story line is often depressing, there are glimpses of hope.When I first started reading the book, I thought the story was going to be about the series of events that stemmed from Tama's attack on Maia. And, to an extent, that's what the story is about. But that's not entirely true. For many of these characters, their lives were on track toward a going-nowhere existence long before Tama's lapse in judgment. These characters are immune to violence. It's a way of life. Their lives are rooted in despair, and they are destined for crime, poverty, and tragedy. They have their own moral code and settle their own scores, often reluctant to get the police involved.But just when you think the book is a long string of horrific events, the author delves deep, introducing us to the real person underneath the persona. We meet Jess--a mother who loves her child and husband unconditionally. Nike--a man who is loyal to his wife and determined to take care of his family any way he can. Mikey--a damaged teen with an unimaginable secret. Rory--a man who, on the surface, is just a do-nothing stepfather, but who steps up to the plate when his family needs him the most. Tama--on the surface, he seems to be lacking a conscience entirely, but we see glimpses of remorse that are hidden beneath a deep seated pathology. Tama is a very complex character who sets this story in motion. I spent most of the book hating him, but there was a tiny part of me that felt sorry for him and wanted him to redeem himself. Not all the characters in this book are victims. We meet characters with moral strength and compassion.I could probably ramble on about this book all day. I'll certainly be thinking about it for a long time. It's the kind of book that stays with you, that makes you think about nature versus nurture, and whether or not some people are born without or conscience, or some people have it beaten out of them through circumstance. This book is very well-crafted and the writing is flawless, but it is very violent with graphic sexual content. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a serious, thought-provoking read.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DQIi6wpvL.jpg

It's the type of book that makes me wish the others in the three-book set are complete, because I really want to immerse myself in the story once again. It's the type of book that also makes me wish I could give it more than five stars because my enjoyment of this book goes way beyond, well... enjoyment. I finished reading the book a day ago, but I can't get it off my mind. I feel deeply affected by not only the story, but by the questions raised within the pages of this well-written book.Stark raises questions most of us never consider. After the September 11 terrorist attacks, I think most people have some idea of the havoc created by such an event. I think most people can even puzzle out what might happen after a nuclear attack. But, how many people stop to consider the ripple effect such an event might cause? What happens to those who survive the blast, only to discover their homes will remain uninhabitable for generations to come? Where do all those people go? And, how does a government that is barely holding up under crushing debt manage to find the resources to support millions of refuges? What happens when the economy begins to crumble, or when insurance companies file bankruptcy?This book is well-researched and raises issues most readers have never considered. It's thorough, factual, and remarkably unbiased. Stark writes in a very straightforward manner and keeps his own political opinions from interfering with the story. What really sets this book apart, though, is the author's ability to go way beyond the obvious environmental, economic, and political repercussions of a nuclear terrorist attack. He also looks at our country's deep-seated prejudices. He shows us the ugly side of humanity and people who seek to profit from disaster, and shows us those who use tragedy as an excuse to let lawlessness run rampant. He introduces us to a conspiracy theorist who has the ability to tap into the fears of like-minded individuals who are willing to act on their hatred. He also delves into the psyche of a man who is forced to harness almost unlimited power while under immense pressure and personal grief.May Day is a multifaceted read that kept me glued to my e-reader. It's a thought-provoking, well-written book I would recommend to everyone over 18. It isn't often that I can recommend a book to all readers, regardless of the type of book they like to read. But, in this case, I can make an exception. The book is highly readable--the type of book that should be made into a movie. Read it and really think about the question, &#34;What if?&#34;",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51H50Dtr9-L.jpg

When a stranger calls her and asks her to meet him, she balks at the idea. But how can she resist his promise to tell her what really happened to Patrick? Against her better judgement, she meets the stranger (Jorick) and finds herself caught up in a world she never knew existed. Katelina's life is in danger, and only Jorick can protect her.I loved, loved, loved this book. The story moves quickly, but the reader is still given ample opportunity to get to know the characters, the world they live in, and the rules that govern their culture. The vampires in this novel are complex and varied. Some, like Kateesha, Michael, and Claudius, are ruthless, power-hungry, and terrifying. Others, like Oren and Torina, are driven by revenge. And then we have Jorick. Jorick can be ruthless and violent when he must be, but for the most part, he just wants to exist free of covens and vampire-drama. He's also loyal, willing to help Oren and Torina even though he isn't invested in their battle. Katelina brings out a different side of him. With her, he's protective and passionate. This is the way vampires should be, folks. This is the type of vampire series I've been looking for and finally found. No one sparkles in the sun or attends high school. Did I mention I'm becoming a huge Joleene Naylor fan? Yep. I immediately bought book two and can't wait to get started on it. If you're a vampire fan, please check out this series.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41p91rENmVL.jpg

He won't let anything deter him from finding his missing sister, Meggie. Grace, the mysterious waitress whose caught Connor's eye, is definitely a distraction. Connor is drawn to Grace, and for the first time in years, he considers settling down, but not until Meggie is found. Grace is a woman with secrets which have the potential to destroy any possibility of a future with Connor. And now that the criminals stalking Connor have set their sites on her as well, she's in more danger than she ever imagined possible.My love for this series is no secret. I'm a hardcore Shirleen Davies fan and I'm happy to say this book met all my expectations. There's tons of romance in this book, but like all the books in the MacLarens of Fire Mountain series, romance is never easy. These characters are complex and have issues to resolve before they can share a life with someone else. For Connor, his personal hangups and sense of morality is his worst enemy. For Grace, her secrets are her downfall.Like the other books in the series, Davies re-introduces the other beloved members of the MacLaren clan. For me, it's like seeing old friends. All the details of the previous books come flooding back and instantly transports me to Fire Mountain. The breathtaking scenery of the old West is brought to life within the pages of this series and it makes it so, so difficult to put the book down for any length of time. The author describes pre-state Utah and the dilemma faced by Mormons in plural marriages who suddenly found their lifestyles illegal, and she did an excellent job handling the sensitive aspects of the story line.Deadlier Than the Rest earns another easy five star rating from me.

As the room fills with people, Andy is inexplicably drawn to one of the strangers. Or, maybe he isn't a stranger at all. Andy feels like she knows John and from the way he keeps watching her, she suspects he might feel the same way. As secrets are revealed and challenges are faced, the inhabitants of the room disappear one by one. Can Andy face the secrets of her own past and reach for what she's always dreamed of?This book started out a little rough for me, but evolved into something I absolutely could not put down. At first, the writing seemed a bit stilted and didn't quite gel with the dreamy atmosphere the author was trying to create. By the end of the book, however, I found the writing to be beautiful, lyrical, and more complex. As the story evolved, the character's challenges and the solutions to their problems became more complex as well, and the story I wasn't sure I was going to like became something I'm very grateful to have read.The author explores such themes as bullying, envy, standing up for oneself, facing one's fears, friendship, courage, and the importance of honesty. There are some strong moral lessons in this novel and the author delivers them in such a way that it doesn't feel preachy. It's a worthwhile read for teens about fourteen and older, but I think adults would enjoy it as well. I sure did.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41eV8ja7qRL.jpg

The characterization was excellent, and Elise was believable.  I want to make it clear that this is not 'a bad book' in that sense.Unfortunately, this story just drips with misogyny.  The werewolf culture described isn't just 'backward,' socially; it's medieval.  The 'alpha,' and all of the others in charge, are male.  The 'alpha female's' job is to cook and arrange gatherings (no joke).  Arranged marriages are still a norm.  Females are expected to be virgins until they're married (mated), and proof of their virginity is actually examined on their wedding night.Despite having access to the internet and presumably a modern education, the main character acknowledges the 'backward' traditions, but then goes on to NOT REALLY QUESTION THEM.  She goes along with an arranged marriage because she's too timid to leave the pack.  At one point, her mate actually rapes her (she said no, very clearly, regardless of any bodily reactions), and afterward, she's worried about HIS feelings - that he didn't like her.  Ugh...The intrigue and murder mystery were okay, but the primary issue I had with them was the fact that I already knew who was responsible for the problems, less than halfway through the book.Not a poorly written book.  Good worldbuilding.  Good characterization.  Just not the type of culture or mentality that I enjoy seeing portrayed as normal or okay.  (You can't blame it on their being wolves, either - 60% of wild wolf packs are led by females, so all that sexual segregation and misogyny is purely human).",3.0,"http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41oDS-ZQ7kL._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-sticker-v3-big,TopRight,0,-55_SX278_SY278_PIkin4,BottomRight,1,22_AA300_SH20_OU01_.jpg"

That having been said, I loved the worldbuilding in the book, and the fight scenes were exciting.The idea of the sirens and their history was very intriguing, and I was left wanting answers to several questions.  Were the sirens building their numbers up for some specific purpose or event?  Were they opportunistic, or did they often come to land in search of prey?  I have not read any of the previous books, so this was a new experience for me.

Though it was set in the distant future, I did have difficulty believing that the President would consult with the Pope and turn something of such great significance over to him.

As a former Mormon - I was only a Mormon for about 1 1/2 years when I was a teen - I can attest to a lot of what she says as being the truth.  Coming from a Baptist background, I remember questioning  about why the wearing of the cross of Christ was &#34;unnecessary&#34;, and asking why water was served as part of the sacrament instead of juice or wine.  I was told that it was because of the commandments in the Doctrine and Covenants.  Basically it was:  follow blindly and don't think for yourself.I enjoyed reading of Kay's experiences, but she really needed to do a lot more editing.  Throughout the book, I would notice that there were a lot of &#34;missing&#34;  words.  There was also a lot of jumping around from the past to the present, but I could still follow along.Having read from various sources about this cult during my adult years,  I found out that quite a bit had been hidden from me, before and after I joined the LDS.  I have no disagreements on anything she'd written concerning the Mormon experience, however, I do take issue regarding what she says Jesus said or didn't say.  The Holy Bible has always been to me (even when I became LDS) the written Word of God, and no where in the Bible does it condone homosexuality, either in the Old or New Testament, or gay marriage.
