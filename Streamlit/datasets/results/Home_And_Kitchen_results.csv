I purchased this size and also the smaller cube size.  Tovolo is the brand to get!!!  Period!!  (In the beginning I tried a couple of other brands and couldn't get rid of them fast enough....they were so flimsy....just awful).Now, I'll start off by saying it does take using them a couple of times to get it perfect.  Use both hands until you figure out the trick to holding them with one.  It might seem difficult to use them at first but don't give up.  I fill them completely to the top and then tilt and pour a little bit out from the right and do the same to the left.  How full you want to leave them is up to you.  After a couple of times I figured out how full to leave them (it's a personal preference). At first getting the cubes out seemed difficult, but there again, after a couple of tries I figured it out.  What works for me is twisting the tray in different directions and flip it over and pop them out with my thumb.  Or just set it out for a minute and they will fall out.  Just don't give up. In no time they'll be working just as you want them to.  Like I said I got the two sizes and I'm glad I did.

I purchased this size and also the larger cube size.  Tovolo is the brand to get!!!  Period!!  (In the beginning I tried a couple of other brands and couldn't get rid of them fast enough....they were so flimsy....just awful).Now, I'll start off by saying it does take using them a couple of times to get it perfect.  Use both hands until you figure out the trick to holding them with one.  It might seem difficult to use them at first but don't give up.  I fill them completely to the top and then tilt and pour a little bit out from the right and do the same to the left.  How full you want to leave them is up to you.  After a couple of times I figured out how full to leave them (it's a personal preference). At first getting the cubes out seemed difficult, but there again, after a couple of tries I figured it out.  What works for me is twisting the tray in different directions and flip it over and pop them out with my thumb.  Or just set it out for a minute and they will fall out.  Just don't give up. In no time they'll be working just as you want them to.  Like I said I got the two sizes and I'm glad I did.  The different sizes are great for different uses.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JM8SFJCDL._SX300_.jpg

I drink iced coffee all the time during the summer months (in Florida that's a lot of months...LOL) and what I love about using the Toddy is that the coffee is strong and when the ice melts I'm not drinking nasty tasting coffee water.  This also came in very handy a few years back when we had a Hurricane.  I could boil water on the grill when we lost power and had a great cup of coffee.

Looks and feels of a higher quality. It has better suction than the Dirt Devil even though the Dirt Devil has plenty of suction. Easier to empty the dust bin. Filter stays cleaner a bit longer. It has a larger cleaning nozzle, which makes it easier to clean larger areas. Has a rotating brush that can be useful. Hose is much more convenient than the Dirt Devil, it stays with the machine.  Crevice tools attaches to hose. Easier to wind the cord.  It's only negative is it is much larger than the Dirt Devil. Of course you do need to keep the filter clean like all hand held vacuums or you lose suction rapidly. Filters are not easy to clean in either machine unless you wash them or vacuum them. Both vacuums are noisy, but that is understandable considering their suction power.The Dirt Devil cordedThe on/off switch is difficult to operate. The filter clogs faster.  I find that I need to clean the filter daily. It is okay to empty but harder and less convenient then the Eureka. The crevice tool broke, perhaps I did not operated it gently, you do need to pull it out to engage the tool. The vacuum feels cheap. The cleaning nozzle is small. The cleaning nozzle has a more vertical suction position that feels unnatural to use. The attachment hose is hard to connect. Its not that I dislike the vacuum but it has lost some of its charm. It is very light and has great suction when the filter is not dirty. It is more handy for small jobs.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NtHZMhjJL._SY300_.jpg

The filter clogs faster than most. The crevice tool broke,perhaps I operated it not gently,  the vacuum feels cheap. The cleaning nozzle is small. The cleaning nozzle has a more vertical suction position that feels unnatural to use. The attachment hose is hard to connect. Its not that I dislike the vacuum but it has lost some of its charm. It is very light and has great suction when the filter is not dirty. I find that I need to clean the filter daily. It is okay to empty but harder then the Eureka.I recently bought the Eureka EasyClean Corded. It has better suction, easier to empty dust bin. Filter stays cleaner a bit longer. It has a larger cleaning nozzle. Has a rotating brush that can be useful. Hose is much more convenient than the Dirt Devil. It looks nicer and has more quality built in. It's only negative is is much larger than the Dirt Devil.The dirt devil will still be used for smaller jobs.This vacuum has excellent suction, with an easy push button empty of the dust bin.  It is a bit noisy but for the suction power that is completely understandable.  I don't think it is heavy in fact I consider it the necessary weight for that type of vacuum. It does blow filter air at the back. The cord is long enough for any room. It does pick up cat litter easily, and I use it also to clean the rubber mats in my clinic. I chose the cord because I needed full suction power at all times. There are a few attachments that might be welcome. I like the floor attachment. Highly recommended!",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41SFMRtnpvL._SX300_.jpg

Before you hang these, you hang the organizer hanger horizontal, which takes up more space than the original clothes, then you unhook one end and let the clothes cascade down.

Measuring cups measure fluid ounces...8 oz of elbow pasta, for example, is far more than a cup because of the air in between the pasta.  So, for accuracy (and especially if counting calories), and in baking, it's just a must for me.This surprised me because I have had a favorite scale for a few years that I didn't think could be outdone.  However, this is a winner.  First of all, don't let the size fool you.  You can weigh really big things on it such as huge pots.  You just center them on the scale.  The item does not have to be, in other words, the size of the scale.  Because this has 4 weight measuring units, it ensures accuracy.It has a tare feature which to me is imperative.  Let's say you have a mixing bowl on the scale. You measure out 5 ounces flour then you want to add 4 ounces sugar the the recipe--you don't need to dump out the flour to measure it; you simply tare it out and it goes back to zero.  This is even more important so you can use any bowl or plate with it.  For example, if I put a 4 ounce bowl on top of it, I then tare it out and it says zero and I add 5 ounces water and get the exact measurement.I won't buy any scales without lithium batteries now.  They just don't last long enough and that means they start having poor accuracy. This has the lithium battery.One of the more impressive things is that it goes up to 11 pounds in weight.  Many small scales only go to 4 pounds.This stores easily in a drawer or cabinet as it is thin and the tempered glass means simple clean up, with an easy to read digital design.Meets my needs.Scale provided by Surpahs.

But if you are just looking to measure small amounts at a time this would suit many.hen I was a weight loss couch I used to shock everyone by showing people exactly why they needed a kitchen scale in addition to their bathroom scale if they wanted accuracy in food.It's crazy to me that in America no one gets this unless they go to culinary school it seems--people will tell you that 8 ounces is a cup, but they do not realize that a cup measures fluid ounces. Anything with air and spaces, such as meat or elbow pasta etc, is measured not in fluid ounces--simply in ounces. So, let's say a recipe calls for 8 ounces of elbow macaroni. You'd wind up using about half of what you are supposed to if you use a measuring cup.A measuring cup will work for flour, sugar, and things that are hard packed--not veggies, proteins, pasta etc. For that, you need this.For baking, it is very important in order to get the same results each time though if you are creating a family recipe or something you will make often, but I won't go into a culinary lesson here.Because I also use a scale for shipping, I have used my share of them.So my favorite kitchen scale I have used is the Mira.  Unlike most that use regular AA or AAA batteries that die too often, it has the round kind that lasts FOREVER...and when scales start losing battery power, they get less accurate so that matters to me.I like the glass top on this one as it's easy to clean.  However, I am more a fan of the scales that are flat with the glass top connected to the top of the scale (hard to explain but most of the scales now have this feature) for a few reasons. First, it is not easy to clean UNDER this glass platform.  Secondly, if you put something like a large pot on it that is not centered, it will go off balance and weigh incorrectly, whereas it is more stable when there is no glass platform ABOVE the scale.I like the tare function and it's easy to read.  It is not as easy to store as the smaller flat ones in a drawer or between your cookbooks because this one has the raised platform.So it's good...but it will not replace my Mira for everyday use, although I use this one for my packages.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4196qrnjzGL._SY300_.jpg

I explained that for a pot lid, however, I was having great issue.  When I put them on the pot, they suction, but once they get warm, they expand and release.  First, they slipped into the pot several times, but more importantly, even when they sat atop the pot, they warp in use due to the expansion and then one corner will stay raised, allowing all the steam to escape.I was told by the manufacturer that all pot lids lift up and allow steam to escape the same (?)  and I explained that was untrue, which is why some recipes call for a covered pot and others tell you to leave it uncovered.  I explained that I'm a chef and so if they weren't meant for things I was using for, I just needed to know.  They then said I am out of touch with the home cook and have a different need for pot lids.  Untrue. I had no intention of using these commercially. I wished to cook for friends and family at HOME...like any home cook boiling potatoes etc.So, from many uses I can say that while your metal lids will hold in the steam, these will lift up above the pot and release all of it--but if you are wanting it simply to stop grease spatters, on a low pan, then they should work.  The part about them suctioning on only works when cold. Once hot, they will release so just be aware.  On recipes that require the steam to cook with the ingredients, you will most assuredly not get the same results with these.  But you CAN use them in the microwave with good results.For that reason I gave them 3 stars.  They won't in any way replace your pot lids if you have recipes calling for you to cover the pot, because you will lose all your steam still, but they do have their place.Unfortunately the manufacturer got kind of rude and in a debate with me when I simply told them I may be using it wrong and for me to get info on how they are to be used and tried to tell me covered pots let all the steam out always...so I really could not get answers.They did provide these to me for my review and I really liked their silicone kitchen utensils but maybe I just caught them in a bad mood when I had questions on the use of these and how mine kept falling into the pot and the edges lifting up during cooking.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31-EZBrVBsL._SX300_.jpg

I recognize that they are even slightly thin.  But I kid you not, THESE feel JUST like those sheets.There is something about sliding into them and feeling kind of a cotton feel, yet a sleek silky feel as well.I can't describe the soft.  It's just to die for.Not kidding--these beat the best and most expensive sheets I've bought in order to replicate that sleep I had there.  And if you had told me that, I'd have thought you were nuts because these are the most affordable sheets Ive owned in ages.It turns out you can get more than you paid for.Sheets provided by Honey Moon",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ZVmSrzKRL._SX300_.jpg

It should be noted that this is sold by a U.S company in Fairfield NJ (Telebrands) according to the box and brochure so they are required to test for lead themselves, of course, but I double check on pottery.So, looking at the make up of this gadget I'd first say it's only for single servings--it's not a big pot.  Clay cookery, however, is known for keeping moisture and flavor in food while being easy to clean and dishwasher safe so I wondered how it would work in the microwave, a known gadget for drying out food.The second think I noticed is that while it is covered, steam is able to be released from the center of the pot.  This appears the secret for keeping foods from getting watery while locking in moisture.I started with an omelette.  I think this is one of the handiest components of this gadget because you can make a fast 2 egg omelette and have no pans to handwash afterwards.  You need to really whip up your eggs with a fork first and you can do that right inside the pot with no extra bowl needed.  I knew better than to assume this is non-stick on matter what the box said.  Ceramic is inherently &#34;less sticky&#34; but unless you are cooking a fat-laden food in it like a pie crust, you are going to have some stick.  So I sprayed it with olive oil first.  And it's a good thing I did.  I then added chopped baby spinach, salsa, mushrooms, cheese and salt and pepper to my omelette.What happens next is entirely up to your microwave.  All microwave ovens vary in power so you can't blame yours cooking slowly entirely on the pot.  I would say the instructions of cooking time are likely based upon a 1,000 wattage microwave because mine did cook perfectly in exactly 1.5 minutes.  If you have larger eggs, add more mixins or have more cheese it may take longer.It was surprisingly fluffy in my opinion and the pot is good looking enough to serve it right in the pot.  Now granted a round omelette is not what I would serve guests but to pop an English muffin in the toaster and serve it to myself that fast loaded with protein and veg, it's a happy breakfast--especially because you prep it, cook it, serve it all in the same dish then throw it in the dishwasher.It also did well on the veggie chili recipe and the baked potoato but you have to dice up the potato to make it work well here.  It's by no means a baked potato cooker in the traditional sense but sure made a nice meal with some broccoli and cheese and the leftover chili.The handle part is cool to the touch and it's actually very nice looking with it being a piece of handthrown pottery.I took off one star because the recipe book is pretty basic.  And it's hard to wrap your brain around what can actually be done well in this pot although I look forward to experimenting.  I also don't like that it advertises itself as non-stick when you should mist it with olive oil if it's a low fat recipe.The French onion soup was great even though I did some adaptations and the baked banana dessert over ice cream was also a hit.I'm  a pretty huge fan of my silicone cookers for vegetables in the microwave but I'll give it a try.  This is heavier and bulkier to store but handy enough for a faster microwave dish and for eggs you do use far less fat and you don't have to flip them so on the go, it seems to have it's place in a kitchen when you are on the go and cooking for just yourself that day.",4.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/619Laz-XIpL._SY300_.jpg

Anything with air and spaces, such as meat or elbow pasta etc, is measured not in fluid ounces--simply in ounces. So, let's say a recipe calls for 8 ounces of elbow macaroni.  You'd wind up using about half of what you are supposed to if you use a measuring cup.A measuring cup will work for flour, sugar, and things that are hard packed--not veggies, proteins, pasta etc.  For that, you need this.For baking, it is very important in order to get the same results each time though if you are creating a family recipe or something you will make often, but I won't go into a culinary lesson here.Because I also use a scale for shipping, I have used my share of them.Some things that stand out for me on this one are that it has a glass top for easy cleaning, it does not require you to put things in a bowl that comes with it on top, so you can just center items like a large box on top and it weighs items much larger than the scale, and it will measure up to 11 pounds which is higher than many kitchen scales reach.It measures with accuracy, has an auto-off, and a zero out or tare button.  All things I like.I prefer scales that use the round battery rather than AA or AAA because they last longer but this one does come with an extra set of batteries and I think for the regular home cook this style will work fine--I overuse a scale so I am the exception rather than the norm.I also prefer one that lights up so the dial is always easier to read but that may be my own quirk.On the main points and for accuracy this one works great so I give it 5 stars.Scale provided by Procizion",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EHB9c34vL._SX300_.jpg

I kept the cheeses but had to exchange the dome.Why?  While this is great for American marketing where one is not aware unless they talk to a cheesemonger than cheese should not be served cold, it actually inhibits the taste of the cheese for a few reasons.First, the marble does keep the cheese cold. Cheese is not even aged cold; it's aged at room temp and bringing it to room temp again will have a huge difference in flavor because the fat molecules, the primary component of cheese, are not constricted, opening up more flavor.  In fact some types of cheese in uncut wheels can be left at room temp for YEARS.  I know, the American myth...That said, there are many types of cheese and so there can be no set rule for every type. But some rules are fairly vast such as:Non-porous materials such as marble and plastic wrap suffocate cheese, bringing out an ammonia flavor (particularly in soft cheeses). They also cause cheese to mold more quickly because they trap moisture.  You will often see some gourmet cheese wrapped in a deli paper; this is the proper way and it allows the cheese to breathe.  You can also keep it in a dome with a wooden base--as that is more porous.I enjoy a snack of a few fine cheeses in the evening while I cook dinner. For this, I put my cheeses in the dome in the morning before work.  They are extraordinary when I get home.  I just bought a glass dome lid to go over a wooden block I had and that's ideal.Avoid plastic wrapped pre-cut cheeses and ask your cheesemonger wherever you buy to actually cut from the wheel and you'll also notice a big difference in flavor.  You can store in your dome in your fridge and just take out and allow to reach room temp before serving.  It's fine to be wrapped in plastic just for your trip home from the store though; and common.If you want perfect cheese with no dome, unwrap from the plastic wrap meant for travel from the deli or cheese shop and get cheese formaticum paper. It's made for ultimate freshness  If you buy a few kinds of cheese at a time, wrap in this, then just set out  awhile before you plan on serving or eating.  You won't believe the difference in taste and butteriness--like the dome.Why I personally prefer to store in a dome? Cheese kept at perfect humidity and climate is better--and this automatically creates that exact climate, which is why cheese domes are around.  Just choose one with a wooden base for proper climate.Drastic temps are not good for cheese flavor--best not to go in and out of the fridge a bunch.  You actually can leave it out and eat the next day. It's done in France everyday, afterall.And finally, if you have a type of cheese that sweats, just wipe it off with a cloth.",2.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41R5S9KwR8L._SX300_.jpg

I cook with it so often that I have a few garlic presses and even garlic shavers because one is always in the dishwasher.While pre-chopped and pre-minced garlic is available in the groceries, it's not even the same animal--it's mixed with chemical and preservatives in order to keep it shelf stable, and chopping it in advance deters it's flavor, so it's simply not the same taste as fresh garlic.Not everyone wants to bite into a burst of garlic flavor like I do, so a garlic press is an excellent way to get fresh garlic into your sauces and casseroles and other dishes.  It's excellent, for example, on roasted asparagus simply with lemon olive oil and salt and pepper.But let's get to the press:  The thing about a poorly made garlic press is that, since you are using this to press down on something (the garlic clove), it will break if it's not a good one.  I always go for the heavier and well-built commercial grade garlic presses and this is exactly what you have here.

Many use in boats to eliminate mildew, or basements if homes have them in your area, but regardless of where you need a dehumidifier, it was kind of fascinating to see it collect water that is usually airborne.And it did just that-it takes it in and you dump it out.And it did so quietly as well as compared to another dehumidifier I'd used in the past.I'd recommend this unit--it does as promised.Dehumidifier provided by Ivation; review is my honest and unbiased opinion",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YhOJFBpnL._SY300_.jpg

They work well and are accurate.  As a chef, I'm happy with them and I have scales around the house like some people have pairs of scissors.I'm going to first start with the very confusing part of it.  I am continually explaining to people the difference between cups and ounces.  And I can tell you that when I was a weight loss coach, 100 percent of those in my classes had no idea that a cup of cubed chicken is not 8 ounces.  Or that 8 ounces of elbow macaroni is about twice what will fit in a 1 cup measuring cup even though one cup says 8 ounces.  &#34;A measuring cup is 8 ounces!&#34; people would say. Then I'd show them that measuring cups say &#34;FLUID&#34; ounces...so they can only measure things that are either fluid or so heavily packed in the cup that there is no air in between (like flour, sugar, rice) but could in no way accurately measure chopped meat, noodles, or anything else that was not packed but had air in between (like cereal, vegetables). For those items you need a kitchen scale  In other words, if  a recipe says &#34;8 ounces cubed chicken) it's not a cup.  If it says &#34;1 cup cubed chicken&#34; it is a cup.  But measuring cups are actually FLUID ounces and only meant for liquids.So...this scale says it measures fluid ounces.  Fluid ounces have NOTHING to do with weight...it is a measurement of fluid capacity.  Thank you for furthering America's confusion of nutrition and recipes, Smart Weigh...work with me now...have mercy.  What are they doing with this?  Measuring cups measure fluid ounces.  Otherwise they are no different than regular ounces.And that is what you need the scale for.  So, while it accurately does measure weight.  If you are saying to yourself  &#34;Self!! Lookit! This one here measures fluid ounces and no other scale does! This one is the winner!&#34; Please, hit your search engine for the meaning of fluid ounces rather than messing up all your future recipes.  Or starving on a diet because you have been measuring out 4 ounces of pasta in a half cup measuring cup.  The US fluid ounce is based upon the gallon, which is based on the wine gallon, used in England in the 1800s.Okay then, now that I have explained that bit of confusion (my only reason for deleting a star--you don't need this on a weight scale, God love ya...that would be like measuring my size 8 blouse on a scale.  It's what fits inside the blouse that makes it fit, (the capacity) not how much the blouse weighs.(the weight)  Now you get it?  A kitchen scale can best measure weight, no need for a fluid ounce button on it.Okay, so if you get it, just no need to push that fluid ounce button.Other than that, this ROCKS--accurate, auto off button to save electricity, small enough to fit in a drawer or cabinet yet you can center large items on it and still get an accurate read, I LOVE the timer on it, and it measures a bit over 11 pounds accurately which should be plenty.My favorite thing about it is the hole in it so I can hang it!  That, and the timer, earned it an extra star back!  I have never seen those two features before!Nice timer, accuracy, handy and great scale.Scale provided by Smart WeighReview is my unbiased opinion",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41U2r8p-zAL._SY300_.jpg

I actually bought a second scale just like my first, because1. I can't live without it2. It's the best on the marketIf you look at my reviews I own a closet full of scales because companies send them to me to review as a top reviewer.  I have some really good scales. But to date, in the last 3 years, this is the model I keep out and use all the time.It is ALWAYS correct in accuracy.  I test my scales with scale weights to be sure.  I actually use this one more than my $600 commercial scale when working with clients in developing new recipes.It's super fast.The battery lasts about 10 times longer than a regular scale, making it pay for itself.  Why? It uses the round batteries that last forever where most use the AA or AAA batteries that you have to change out all the time.It fits away in a drawer because it is so small yet it will measure big boxes and pots--just center them in the middle and you can still read the readout due to it being under the topThe top is glass so it's easy to cleanThis shows more accuracy--for example, I can know something is 5.47 ounces rather than 5.4 ounces like most scales might readThe tare function is faster than other scales.The readout lights upI use my scales so much that I was breaking a scale every 6 months. This scale is now 3 years old. It's a workhorse.I can measure in all ounces or pounds and ounces, or grams etc.I drop it, bang it around, carry it to work and back, leave it in my car.  I can't hurt it.It tells me when the battery is running low on the readout--it tells me how full the battery is at ALL times.  Others scales just windup giving you the wrong reading then suddenly a message says the battery is gone and you are in the middle of a recipe and have to run out and buy new batteries. With this one, you know how much life you have in your battery so you know when to replace it.I like it enough that I had to buy a second one just in case they ever discontinue it because I love it that much.I just realized I have not reviewed this yet...I thought I'd given it a shout out long ago!Not sure if you need a scale or not?When I was a weight loss couch I used to shock everyone by showing people exactly why they needed a kitchen scale in addition to their bathroom scale if they wanted accuracy in food.It's crazy to me that in America no one gets this unless they go to culinary school it seems--people will tell you that 8 ounces is a cup, but they do not realize that a cup measures fluid ounces. Anything with air and spaces, such as meat or elbow pasta etc, is measured not in fluid ounces--simply in ounces. So, let's say a recipe calls for 8 ounces of elbow macaroni. You'd wind up using about half of what you are supposed to if you use a measuring cup.A measuring cup will work for flour, sugar, and things that are hard packed--not veggies, proteins, pasta etc. For that, you need this.For baking, it is very important in order to get the same results each time though if you are creating a family recipe or something you will make often, but I won't go into a culinary lesson here.Because I also use a scale for shipping, I have used my share of them.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31wLhUO8gpL._SX300_.jpg

I have one for kitchen, I use one in my baths and have one at the office.What sets these apart from other steamers in the pressure.  Pressurized steam is SO different.  If you have soft steam gently coming out, you do get sanitized heat on your floors, bath, etc, but the cleaning power is very much diminished.  Why? The pressure pushing that steam out in a powerful manner means the strong heat hits what you want clean, let's say your baseboards, or the base of your toilet around the tile, and it powers away any grime or dust WHILE sanitizing with the heat.And that makes all the difference.Also, whereas most steamers have steam that cools as it travels out through the hose, this one powers out so it reaches the attachments or steam mop full-heat ahead.I have owned and tried out several other steam mops and in the end they were set aside for the McCollochs.  My favorite is their largest one just because it holds more water but they all work with the strong power and pressurized steam.  At least all these new ones, and I like that this one is more portable.I'm not so crazy about the pads on the bottom of the steam mop but they get better and more absorbent after you wash them as long as you don't use fabric softener which makes all things less absorbent.  The good news is that the steamer has velcro on the bottom so you can get creative with your hand towels as well and some velcro in a pinch.Simply a powerhouse, I have no idea why someone didn't think of using pressurized steam sooner.

Pieces were never even and it was quite the project.Enter the apple peeler.  First, it comes like a beautiful gift the way it's boxed.  Via an easy suction snap, it adhered right to the granite (easy on, easy off), it's made well with it being medal but here's the fun part:Pull back the spokey part and put the apple on the spokes.  As you begin turning the crank, not only does the mechanism automatically peel each apple, it cores it perfectly as well, eliminating the stem too.  You are left with perfectly uniform components for the most fantastic pies or desserts!But that's not all kids!  You can put a potato on it and it will peel the potato and you can make curly potatoes or scalloped potatoes with perfection, ease, and in no time at all!  Simply having something that peels my apples and my potatoes for me would excite me enough, but to slice it too is great.This could get kids involved in cooking, depending upon their age, as well.And speaking of them, this helps put together apple slices for lunch side dishes that are ready in a flash and great for dipping in peanut butter!A fun gadget that really is worth having even if you rarely make apple desserts or potato dishes--for the times that you do, it's so worth it!Peeler provided by PureliteReview is my unbiased opinion.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514i8h3jitL._SY300_.jpg

When I went to replace it, I saw the Dyson DC-41 and it spoke to me...let me backtrack a bit, as a reviewer I have owned and loved many other vacuum cleaners over the years since I bought the DC25.  They always lost suction eventually even if I loved them at first.  So I had to replace my original Dyson.Then the salesperson told me how Dyson had increased the already incredible suction and let me try out the DC-41....Oh, I SO had to have it.  And I so love it.They have gotten better over the years.So then I was asked to provide feedback on this one.  I couldn't think of anything that could really be improved from the DC-41 to be honest.  Unlike the past Dysons, both of these make make clogs easy--when you suck up that toy mouse you didn't see under the couch but your cat misplaced, and it's stuck anywhere in here, now you can turn knobs to get to any clog or check for anything--no screwdriver is ever needed.  They both have the great suction, but this one has better suction up from the base, even on the sides.And I will be totally honest, I have never had any vacuum cleaner clean a floor like this.This is an animal friendly home, and furry ones at that.  I cook three meals a day and there is TV eating too.  I need good suction.Because this even had major power from the sides of the base roller, it felt more like I had mopped than vacuumed.  And the new roller goes deeper into rugs and carpets so even though my other model had done a great job on my rugs, this picked up dirt that nothing else had reached.The tools are fantastic for those who have furry family.  With velvet dining room chairs in a dark color and cats in light colors who call them a bed, that's a real test.  This new tool for getting fur off furniture is a winner.The telescoping wand is great and even better now that it has a bent tool for the ceiling fan.On bare floors is where it feels on my bare feet more like I mopped than vacuumed.  And the ball does make a huge difference.  When I vacuum under the table, for example, I don't have to back the vacuum up to then go in a different direction.  You can just swerve serpentine around the table legs and under the chairs with ease.It's hard to describe the difference in a vacuum.  You have to see it.  You have to feel what it did not leave behind on your bare feet, but more than that, you have to see things it sucks up from around the edges without missing a beat, and better yet what is sucks up from the depths of rugs that no other vacuum cleaner can reach, and have been there for way too long.I LOVE this bad boy.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31vlzwVvUwL._SY300_.jpg

Anything other than weight is meant for fluid ounces.  Dry ingredients will always measure out differently.  And that means if you want to multiply the recipe in large scale, it falls flat often.So I had been using another scale that had gram weights and it was not panning out--it was slow and it was inaccurate.I went into this, therefore, testing this one out VERY carefully--and in the middle of development of something important to me in a recipe.I know some use it for jewelry weighing when a gram of gold is a huge difference in what matters--but to me, accuracy in something I am creating is that important so that I can recreate it exactly, and multiply servings exactly.And THIS one panned out.  It is not only accurate (I use weights to test, again and again) but I love the protective cover, i love that the stainless steel base makes wiping and cleaning easy, I REALLY love that this one lights up so it's easy to read even in low light or in the evening, I love that I can tare it and zero it out, and I love how fast it works.This one is a workhorse and it's a keeper.

However, it's one of those gadgets that is &#34;like riding a bike&#34;...once you get it and master the skill, you can do it without thinking.We made these for a dinner that consisted of carnivores (okay, omnivores but they mostly eat meat so...), vegetarians and even a vegan.  If I can do all that with this anyone else can get it to work too!For the real ground beef, the lean beef didn't work as well because it didn't have as much release.  Once we had that issue we decided to watch the youtube video and figure out how to make it work.  That helped.So we continued on and the next time we took the suggestion of running this under water before shaping the meat in it as well.  That helped. Oh, and we read the directions more!The key here is to not use too much meat.  You'll wind up having to cook that through, melting all your cheese, and it not staying together so well. Figuring out how much to use happens with practice but they lose a star here for not telling me how much weight in meat I SHOULD use on the top and bottom.  That would have eliminated the learning curve. It says to use 1/3 cup or less but cups are for measuring fluid ounces or powdery ingredients (as there is no air there so fluid ounces work) but for meat, if you are going to give fluid ounces measurement at lest give weight too for better accuracy.  You can use less meat than this as well.  But basically if you measure out 1/3 cup and spread that around the top and bottom it helps you not use too much which results in a massive burger that doesn't stay together if you do that.We also found that using lots of stuffing worked well rather than a little bit of cheese or veggies or both.  Don't be shy there.The veggie meat (Match meat) worked just as well as the real meat.We used goat cheese, chunks of black garlic, and some fire roasted veggies and used Daiya cheese and black garlic and veggies in one.If your burger is really lean meat then you need to make sure it's a very non-stick pan (read: use oil) in it so it doesn't stick because you have to be a bit more gentle with these due to the soft center.The patty is going to be huge but once we mastered this is looked so cool!

I did cut myself moving the tomato back and forth atop the slicer.  I would have fared far better using it like a knife and cutting from the top.  If an adult can use a knife safely they should be able to use this without the protective side guards.I imagine in time it may be second nature....it speeds up the job and makes such wonderfully even slices, just like you might get from the tomato slicing machine at a fast food place.Good but it could be great.",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t6T%2BdiogL._SY300_.jpg

When I went to replace it, I saw the Dyson DC-41 and it spoke to me...(let me backtrack a bit, as a reviewer I have owned and loved many other vacuum cleaners over the years since I bought the DC25. They always lost suction eventually even if I loved them at first.) So I had to replace my original Dyson.  That DC-41 looked like one bad boy and telling me it had twice the suction of any other vacuum did it for me.Yeah, the salesperson told me how Dyson had increased the already incredible suction and let me try out the DC-41....Oh, I SO had to have it. And I so love it.They have gotten better over the years.So then I was asked to provide feedback on this one as well as the DC65 Animal.  Oh the joy! No more toting one upstairs!  I couldn't think of anything that could really be improved from the DC-41 to be honest. But they did improve it.Unlike the past Dysons, both of these make removing clogs easy--when you suck up that toy mouse you didn't see under the couch but your cat misplaced, and it's stuck anywhere in here, now you can turn knobs to get to any clog or check for anything--no screwdriver is ever needed. They both have the great suction, but this one has better suction up from the base, even on the sides.And I will be totally honest, I have never had any vacuum cleaner clean a floor like this.So even though the DC41 was great and did much of what this does, they now have improved the roller at the base so it goes deeper into your carpets.  That is the difference in the DC65.  But even on my bare floors I see better suction on this one as well as the DC65 animal (and I'll get to what's different about both models momentarily).This is an animal friendly home, and furry ones at that. I cook three meals a day and there is TV eating too. I need good suction.Because this even had major power from the sides of the base roller, it felt more like I had mopped than vacuumed. And the new roller did keep its promise and go deeper into rugs and carpets so even though my other model had done a great job on my rugs, this picked up dirt that nothing else had reached.So what's the difference between this one and the DC65 Animal?  The tool attachments on the Animal are fantastic for those who have furry family. With velvet dining room chairs in a dark color and cats in light colors who call them a bed, that's a real test. Their attachment tools  for getting fur off furniture are unparalleled.  This one has a couple attachments but no powerhouse suction attachments like the Dyson65 Animal--for deep cleaning this is great, but if you have fur everywhere, the Animal is worth it to me.The telescoping wand is great and even better now and if you get the DC65 Animal it also has a bent tool for the ceiling fan.On bare floors is where it feels on my bare feet more like I mopped than vacuumed. And the ball does make a huge difference. When I vacuum under the table, for example, I don't have to back the vacuum up to then go in a different direction. You can just swerve serpentine around the table legs and under the chairs with ease.It's hard to describe the difference in a vacuum. You have to see it. You have to feel what it did not leave behind on your bare feet, but more than that, you have to see things it sucks up from around the edges without missing a beat, and better yet what is sucks up from the depths of rugs that no other vacuum cleaner can reach, and have been there for way too long.I LOVE this bad boy.There simply is no vacuum that does what both models of the DC65 do.",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/3192OegQkNL._SY300_.jpg

Not that there is anything wrong with that...but for those of us who have a nose at all, there is a design flaw in the bottle as much as I love the idea.  It may not bother some people but it would be an easy fix and I would pay more if they did.So first, let's get to the idea of the bottle which is great.  All those drink mixes have artificial flavors and preservatives in them along with the flavored fruit powder.  Why not add real flavor and nutrients and antioxidants to your drinks? You can get creative too, like adding blackberries and sage, or cucumbers and lemons (which, incidentally is a natural diuretic so that you will lose water weight).You just open the lid, pop the inner top that has holes in it and a handle, and drop your fruit in and reclose!  There is also a screw top lid that goes over it all for travel.So what's my beef?  Every other water bottle that I own has an inner lid that presses open or a straw-like device allowing you to sip the water while still having the water enclosed.  With this, you are just sipping it straight out of the open screw top lid. The issue with that, although it's like drinking out of a mason jar, is that the enclosure to hold the fruit in is also at the top of the lid.  So when you tip the water bottle to get water, your nose hits this wet enclosure top and by the time you are done with the bottle, you have wiped your nose about 50 times and have no makeup on. Plus when you get to the very bottom and tip the bottle all the way up to get the last sips, the water splashes on your entire face because it is an open bottle at the top but the lid enclosure holds droplets in the openings that surround the whole top.Get past that and you have a flavorful and eco friendly bottle and you really can't beat that--unless it also had an extra top with a sippy mouth to screw on it to make it perfect.Bottle provided by Basily",3.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41160Wua0VL._SY300_.jpg

I did not use the pressure plate to move the ham toward the blade much of the time and it worked well and did not lose a finger or even come close. When I did use the pressure plate to move the ham, it worked very well. It has points on it to prevent whatever is being sliced sticking to the blade at the end of each slice.The unit can be cleaned very easily. Everything comes apart quickly. The blade can be removed easily, as well.The cord storage feature is great. The thickness control stays in place as you slice. It does not move because of the pressure used to move the meat toward the blade.Although the motor is not large, the 615 seems to have very adequate power.A great deal of thought went into the design of this slicer. I found absolutely no shortcomings with this slicer. It seems very well made and should last for years.As an aside, I ordered and used the non serrated blade to slice the ham. It worked fairly well but arrived with a burr on the entire blade. That burr should have been removed by steeling before it was shipped and I am not about to try to do it with my diamond steel.

The only down side is that, if you get a skinnier cob, it will slide through without peeling off much kernel. I believe there may be a way to adjust that, but I haven't figured it out yet. However, for most cobs, it works great. You do have to be a little careful getting the corn out between cobs. It'll come out the opening, but I tend toward banging things when they don't just fall out and that will make corn hop out all over the kitchen. You can easily twist off the top and get everything out, though. Some kernels will try to hide behind the places where it attaches, but you can shake them around and get them out. Or take the top off. It did take me a couple of tries to figure out how to get it open the first time. But again, that was my impatience. Once I got it figured out it was easy.

These are like many others that create this gap..... gaps=spills and spills=messes.I received a free sample.",2.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cpnxUIXsL._SX300_.jpg

I am a rather restless sleeper.  So I often awake to find my covers turned around and my pillows switched.  I have however noticed in the past that when I have a quality pillow and bedding I tend to wake up in a settled position.  I awoke both days still hugging this pillow.  I am a side sleeper so I use two pillows...one small for under my head and another one that I place up close to my chin and hug it.I am pleased with this pillow and intend on purchasing another smaller pillow from them for under my neck.  I will review it when it gets here.  Both of my pillows are right down ancient so they were needing to be replaced.This seems well made.  The sewing is tight with no strings hanging out...... It is a allergy pillow so this next point is important....you can smell nothing from this pillow.

It simply removes the foil from around the bottle.  Place the foil cutter on top of your bottle, squeeze and twist.The corkscrew removes the cork from the wine bottle.  To use, rotate the lever of the corkscrew 180 degrees, wrap the corkscrew's flaps around the head of the bottle, squeeze to anchor in place, move the lever back toward the closed flaps then back out 180 degrees again.  The cork should come out.The aerator is the funnel like pouring device.  It is to be inserted into your wine bottle.  The aerator mixes air into the wine. This process is called decanting, and causes the wine to have a smoother taste.  Aerators come in all different sizes and can be bought separately.  This one is fine as it comes with the set.  When you pour your wine you will hear a bubbling sound which is the air mixing with the wine.Finally, there is an extra corkscrew spiral.  The corkscrew spiral is supposed to be good up to 1,000 cork removals.  No, I have not tested this product by trying to remove a thousand corks.  No, I do not intend to test this product by moving a thousand corks.I am impressed with the build quality of the corkscrew.  The handle has a brush type rubberized grip that is easy to hold.  The pulley mechanism is made of metal, not plastic.  In terms of build quality, the aerator is barely acceptable.All in all, this product will make a great gift for someone who loves wine.[sample provided]",5.0,http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Q%2B9jqO41L._SY300_.jpg

The answer is quite simple, what about when you go places where there is no electricity - like a camping trip.  Actually you could grind your coffee at home then pack it with you, but some people want to feel connected to the way things were long time ago. The fun is actually doing it from scratch.If you are into grinding coffee the old fashion way then this grinder fits the bill.

When filling up your cup, make sure the liquid goes no higher than  inch above the bubbled accent grip as you need to leave room for the snack cup.The cup is listed as a 16 oz drink cup. To use the cup with the snack tray then you can only get 16 ounces into it. If the snack tray is not on the lid then you can put much more liquid in it.  Without the snack part you can fill the cup to the top but then you would not have a lid. Plus, what is the fun in that.Who would I recommend this for?Kids will love having something like this. I am finding it fun and I am not a kid.  I definitely recommend this for children. This would also be nice for someone at the beach who wants a little snack and a cold drink. This would make an awesome gift, especially when buying for someone who has almost everything.  Now here is the kicker: beer drinkers who like to eat peanuts with their beer will fall in love with this container. Yes, you heard me correctly, BEER + PEANUTS!Overall, this product is prime time.
